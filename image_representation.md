## Techniques
- Grayscale/Luminance Representation
- Color Representation
- Feature Extraction : Edges, corners, textures, or more complex representations like HOG (Histograms of Oriented Gradients) or deep features from CNNs.
- Histograms : Image histograms represent the frequency distribution of pixel intensities in an image. They can provide valuable information about the image's contrast, brightness, and overall content.
- Local Descriptors : Representations that describe local regions of an image, such as SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) and SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Features)
- Global Descriptors : ?
- Deep Learning-based Representations : ?
