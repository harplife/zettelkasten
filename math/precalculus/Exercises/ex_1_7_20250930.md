# 1.7 Exercises

## Concepts

1. We can use mathematics to describe a pattern or relationship between things and events in the world, such that they are represented by equations of variables. These equations can then help solve a problem when the value of one or more of the variables are unknown. For example, an equation can describe the relationship between time and height of ball thrown upwards - which means that the height of the ball at a given time can be calculated.
2. Principle, Interest Rate (Simple), and Time.
3. (a) $x^2$ (b) $lw$ (c) $r^2\pi$
4. $1.6$
5. $\frac{1}{x}$
6. $\frac{d}{t}$, $\frac{d}{r}$
