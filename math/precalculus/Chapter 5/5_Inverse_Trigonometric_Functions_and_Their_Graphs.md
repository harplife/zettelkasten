## The Inverse Sine Function

> [!important] Reminder : An inverse function, denoted as $f^{-1}(x)$, is a function that "undoes" the original function $f(x)$, effectively reversing the input and output.
> If $f(x)$ turns input $a$ into output $b$, then $f^{-1}(b)$ turns $b$ back into $a$.

Given a base sine function :

$$
y = \sin x
$$

Its inverse is defined as :

$$
y = \sin^{-1}(x) \quad \text{ or } \quad \arcsin x
$$

The inverse answers :
> "Given the value of $\sin x$, what was the angle $x$?"

The problem with trig functions is that they are not one-to-one functions - which is the requirement for there to be inverse functions.

For example, for $\sin x = \frac{1}{2}$, there are infinitely many angles that gives that value.

> [!important] In order for trig functions to have an inverse, the domain has to be *restricted*.

For sine, its restricted domain is $\left[ -\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2} \right]$.

The restricted domain becomes the **range** for inverse sine.

We know that the range of sine is $[-1,1]$, which then becomes the **domain** of inverse sine.

Inverse trig graphs are reflections across the line :

$$
y = x
$$

Thus, the graph of inverse sine looks like this :

The relationship between sine and inverse sine is summed up as :

$$
\arcsin(\sin x) = x \quad \text{only if } x \in \left[ -\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2} \right]
$$





Sine forgets direction.  
Inverse sine chooses the simplest angle that produces the same height.
