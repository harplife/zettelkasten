## Graphs of Tangent, Cotangent, Secant, and Cosecant

### Tangent

The graph of tangent $y=\tan x$ looks like this :

Reminder that :

$$
\tan x = \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
$$

and tangent represents **slope** of the unit vector pointing at the terminal point.

The slope of the unit vector becomes exponentially steeper as the terminal point moves along the circle counter-clockwise until it the unit vector becomes vertical (where tangent becomes undefined).
- Past that point, it starts at negative slope and goes toward $0$, where it becomes steep again.
- Note that slope is *always increasing*.

Tangent becomes undefined when $\cos x = 0$, which happens at :

$$
x = \frac{\pi}{2} + n\pi
$$

Where $n$ is an integer. These become **vertical asymptotes** in the graph of tangent.

The **period** of tangent is $\pi$. We know this because a slope repeats every half rotation. For example, the unit vector tilted at $\frac{\pi}{6}$ and another at $\frac{7\pi}{6}$ has the same slope.

Tangent is an **odd function**, and so it is symmetric about the origin :

$$
\tan(-x) = -\tan x
$$

Key points of tangent :
- When $x=0$, then $\tan x=0$
- When $x=\pm \frac{\pi}{4}$, then $\tan x=\pm 1$
- When $x$ approaches $\pm \frac{\pi}{2}$, $\tan x$ approaches $\pm \infty$


### Cotangent

The graph of cotangent $y = \cot x$ looks like this :

Reminder that :

$$
\cot x = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}
$$
