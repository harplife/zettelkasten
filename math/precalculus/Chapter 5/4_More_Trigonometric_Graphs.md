## Graphs of Tangent, Cotangent, Secant, and Cosecant

### Tangent and Cotangent

Reminder that :

$$
\tan x = \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
$$

and tangent represents slope of the unit vector.

Tangent becomes undefined when $\cos x = 0$, which happens at :

$$
x = \frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{3\pi}{2}, \frac{5\pi}{2}, \dots
$$

These become **vertical asymptotes** in the graph of tangent.

The **period** of tangent is $\pi$. We know this because a slope repeats every half rotation. For example, the unit vector tilted at $\frac{\pi}{6}$ and another at $\frac{7\pi}{6}$ has the same slope.

Tangent is an odd function,
