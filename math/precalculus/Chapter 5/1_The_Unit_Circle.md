# 5.1 The Unit Circle

## Key Concepts

- The Unit Circle
- Terminal Points on the Unit Circle
- The Reference Number


## The Unit Circle

The <mark class="hltr-trippy">Unit Circle</mark> is the circle of radius $1$ centered at the origin in the xy-plane. Its equation is :

$$
x^2+y^2=1
$$

The Unit Circle is the core of trigonometry because every angle $\theta$ (measured from the positive x-axis) corresponds to exactly one point on this circle.
- This point encodes **all six trigonometric functions** of $\theta$.


## Terminal Points on the Unit Circle

A <mark class="hltr-trippy">Unit Vector</mark> is a vector with a magnitude (length) of exactly $1$, used to represent pure direction, and is denoted with a "hat" (e.g. $\hat{v}$) over the vector symbol.

Let's say there is a unit vector that starts from the origin and ends at $P(1,0)$; its endpoint intersects with the unit circle, which marks its <mark class="hltr-trippy">Initial Point</mark>. Moving the endpoint any arc length $t$ will always intersect the unit circle; after distance $t$, the location where the endpoint finishes its travel is the <mark class="hltr-trippy">Terminal Point</mark>.
- Distance $t$ is measured from the initial point. For $t>0$, the vector is rotated counter-clockwise. For $t<0$, the vector is rotated clockwise.

The circumference of the unit circle is :

$$
C = 2\pi
$$

If a point $P(1,0)$ moves counterclockwise all the way around the unit circle and returns to its original position, it travels a distance of $t=2\pi$.
- If it moves halfway around the circle, it travels a distance of $\pi$. The terminal point is $P(-1,0)$.
- For quarter -> $\frac{\pi}{2}$, $P(0,1)$

The **Special Terminal Points** are terminal points that are convenient to know.

| Distance         | Angle        | Terminal Point                                               |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| $0$ or $2\pi$    | $0$ or $360$ | $P(1,0)$                                                     |
| $\frac{\pi}{6}$  | $30$         | $P\left( \frac{\sqrt{ 3 }}{2}, \frac{1}{2} \right)$          |
| $\frac{\pi}{4}$  | $45$         | $P\left( \frac{\sqrt{ 2 }}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{ 2 }}{2} \right)$ |
| $\frac{\pi}{3}$  | $60$         | $P\left( \frac{1}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{ 3 }}{2} \right)$          |
| $\frac{\pi}{2}$  | $90$         | $P(0,1)$                                                     |
| $\pi$            | $180$        | $P(-1,0)$                                                    |
| $\frac{3\pi}{2}$ | $270$        | $P(0,-1)$                                                    |


## The Reference Number

The <mark class="hltr-trippy">Reference Number</mark> is the shortest distance along the unit circle between the terminal point determined by $t$ and the x-axis, and it is denoted as $\bar{t}$.

<mark class="hltr-green">Example</mark>
If $t=\frac{\pi}{6}$, the shortest distance from the x-axis to the terminal point is still $\frac{\pi}{6}$. Therefore, $\bar{t}=\frac{\pi}{6}$.

<mark class="hltr-green">Example</mark>
If $t=1.3\pi$, the shortest distance from the x-axis to the terminal point is $\bar{t}=0.3\pi$.
