# 5.1 The Unit Circle

## Key Concepts

- The Unit Circle
- Terminal Points on the Unit Circle
- The Reference Number


## The Unit Circle

The <mark class="hltr-trippy">Unit Circle</mark> is the circle of radius $1$ centered at the origin in the xy-plane. Its equation is :

$$
x^2+y^2=1
$$

The Unit Circle is the core of trigonometry because every angle $\theta$ (measured from the positive x-axis) corresponds to exactly one point on this circle.
- This point encodes **all six trigonometric functions** of $\theta$.


## Terminal Points on the Unit Circle

A <mark class="hltr-trippy">Unit Vector</mark> is a vector with a magnitude (length) of exactly one, used to represent pure direction, and is denoted with a "hat" (e.g. $\hat{v}$) over the vector symbol.

The <mark class="hltr-trippy">Terminal Point</mark> is the point on the unit circle where distance $t$ along the unit circle is measured from the positive x-axis.

The circumference of the unit circle is :

$$
C = 2\pi
$$

If a point $P(1,0)$ moves counterclockwise all the way around the unit circle and returns to its original position, it travels a distance of $2\pi$.
- If it moves halfway around the circle, it travels a distance of $\pi$. The terminal point is $P(-1,0)$.
- For quarter -> $\frac{\pi}{2}$.
