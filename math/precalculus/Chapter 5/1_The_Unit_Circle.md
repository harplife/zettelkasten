- The Reference Number


## The Unit Circle

The <mark class="hltr-trippy">Unit Circle</mark> is the circle of radius $1$ centered at the origin in the xy-plane. Its equation is :

$$
x^2+y^2=1
$$

The Unit Circle is the core of trigonometry because every angle $\theta$ (measured from the positive x-axis) corresponds to exactly one point on this circle.
- This point encodes **all six trigonometric functions** of $\theta$.
