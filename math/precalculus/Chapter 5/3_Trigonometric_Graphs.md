## Graphs of Sine and Cosine

![[Circle_cos_sin.gif | center]]

The graph of the cosine function $\cos(\theta)$ reflects the *horizontal* movement of the terminal point as it moves along the circle. The graph of the sine function $\sin(\theta)$ reflects the *vertical* movement.

Note that in both graphs, the "starting" point of the graph is at $(1,0)$ where $\theta=0$. Once the terminal point moves all the way along the circle ($\theta=2\pi$), a single <mark class="hltr-trippy">Period</mark> of the graph has completed - that is to say, the length of one period on the graph is $2\pi$. The values in a period are repeated again and again for each following periods.
- The graph of the sine function starts at $0$ and ends at $0$.
- The graph of the cosine function starts at $1$ and ends at $1$.

We know that the values of $\sin(\theta)$ starts $0$, moves to $1$, back to $0$, moves to $-1$, and then finally comes back around to $0$. The highest value is $1$ and the lowest $-1$. Meaning, the <mark class="hltr-trippy">Range</mark> of the sine graph is $[-1,1]$.
- The range of the cosine graph is $[-1,1]$ as well.

| Parameter | Effect                             |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| $A$       | amplitude (vertical stretch)       |
| $B$       | frequency (horizontal compression) |
| $C$       | phase shift                        |
| $D$       | vertical shift                     |
