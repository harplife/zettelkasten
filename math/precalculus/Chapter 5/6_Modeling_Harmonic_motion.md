# 5.6 Modeling Harmonic Motion

## Key Concepts

- Simple Harmonic Motion
- Damped Harmonic Motion
- Phase and Phase Difference


## (Extra) Periodic Motion

<mark class="hltr-trippy">Periodic Motion</mark> is any motion that repeats itself over regular, fixed intervals of time, following a **cyclical pattern** (e.g. a swing, a clock pendulum, or Earth's orbit around the sun) and **frequency** (cycles per second).

Key characteristics of periodic motion :
- Period
- Frequency
- Amplitude
- Equilibrium Position

Types of periodic motion :
- Oscillatory Motion
- Simple Harmonic Motion

### Oscillatory Motion

Oscillatory Motion is a type of periodic motion where the object moves back and forth about a fixed point (e.g. pendulum).


## Simple Harmonic Motion

<mark class="hltr-trippy">Simple Harmonic Motion</mark> (SHM) is a specific, smooth type of periodic motion (e.g. spring or pendulum) where the restoring force is proportional to the displacement and always points toward an equilibrium position.

SHM is often represented by a sine (or cosine) wave. In its simplest form, the position of the object varies like :

$$
x(t) = A \sin(wt+\phi) \quad \text{ or } \quad x(t) = A \cos(wt+\phi)
$$

Every harmonic system has :
- A rest position (**equilibrium**)
- Motion occurs around that position

Example :
- Mass on a spring --> equilibrium at spring's natural length
- Pendulum --> equilibrium at lowest point
- AC voltage --> equilibrium at $0$ volts.

**Amplitude** describes the maximum displacement from equilibrium.
- It determines how "big" the motion is
- Energy increases with amplitude
- It does not affect the timing of the motion

Example :
- Larger swing of a pendulum
- Louder sound
- Brighter light

**Period** describes time for one full cycle, whereas **Frequency** describes number of cycles per unit time.
