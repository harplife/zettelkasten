# 5.6 Modeling Harmonic Motion

## Key Concepts

- Simple Harmonic Motion
- Damped Harmonic Motion
- Phase and Phase Difference


## (Extra) Periodic Motion

<mark class="hltr-trippy">Periodic Motion</mark> is any motion that repeats itself over regular, fixed intervals of time.

> [!warning] Periodic motion doesn't have to be *uniform* - many periodic motions change speed continuously.

Example of period motions :
- Pendulum
- Earth's orbit around the Sun

Key characteristics of periodic motion :
- Period $T$
- Frequency $f$
- Amplitude $A$

Periodic motion is often described as **rotational**, **oscillatory**, or **orbital**, depending on the geometry of the motion.

> [!important] Rotational, oscillatory, and orbital motion is *descriptive* but it is not categorical.
> In fact, these can overlap. Orbital motion is often just rotational motion, and oscillatory motion can be viewed as a projection of rotational motion.

The simplest kind of periodic motion is a **circular periodic motion**, where an object moves in a circle at constant speed and angle increases uniformly.
- e.g. clock hands, rotating wheels, planets (idealized)

Types of periodic motion :
- Oscillatory Motion
- Simple Harmonic Motion

### Oscillatory Motion

Oscillatory Motion is a type of periodic motion where the object moves back and forth about a fixed point (e.g. pendulum).


## Simple Harmonic Motion

<mark class="hltr-trippy">Simple Harmonic Motion</mark> (SHM) is a smooth and oscillatory periodic motion in which the restoring influence is proportional to the displacement from equilibrium and always directed toward it.

SHM is often represented by a sine (or cosine) wave. In its simplest form, the position of the object varies like :

$$
x(t) = A \sin(wt+\phi) \quad \text{ or } \quad x(t) = A \cos(wt+\phi)
$$

> [!important] A motion that creates a sine wave is said to be **Sinusoidal**.
> **Non-harmonic motion** is a motion that repeats but is not *sinusoidal*. Examples include :
> - Square waves
> - Sawtooth waves
> - Triangle waves
> - Heartbeat signals
> - Gait cycles in walking
> 
> It is also said that sinusoidal motion is *smooth*. In other words, non-harmonic motions are *not* smooth.

Every harmonic system has :
- A rest position (**equilibrium**)
- Motion occurs around that position

Example :
- Mass on a spring --> equilibrium at spring's natural length
- Pendulum --> equilibrium at lowest point
- AC voltage --> equilibrium at $0$ volts.

**Amplitude** describes the maximum displacement from equilibrium.
- It determines how "big" the motion is
- Energy increases with amplitude
- It does not affect the timing of the motion

Example :
- Larger swing of a pendulum
- Louder sound
- Brighter light

**Period** describes time for one full cycle, whereas **Frequency** describes number of cycles per unit time.

<mark class="hltr-trippy">Angular frequency</mark> (rad/s) is the rate of rotation (or oscillation) measuring how fast something spins (or vibrates) in radians per second.
- It quantifies the change in angle over time.

Angular frequency (of a circular motion) is defined as :

$$
\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T} = 2\pi f
$$

Where $T$ is period and $f$ is frequency.
