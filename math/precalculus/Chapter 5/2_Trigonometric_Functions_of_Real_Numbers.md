## The Trigonometric Functions

Let :
- $\theta$ be the angle measured from the positive x-axis (to the unit vector at the terminal point)
- $(x,y)$ be the coordinates of the terminal point at angle $\theta$

The coordinates of each axis can be found by using the two fundamental trigonometric functions :

$$
\begin{align}
  \cos(\theta) &= x \\
  \sin(\theta) &= y
\end{align}
$$

$\cos$ stands for **Cosine**, which represents the horizontal coordinate. $\sin$ stands for **Sine**, which represents the vertical coordinate.

> [!warning] Many apps default to *radians* when it comes to angles.
> Be sure to check which unit of measurement (degree/radian) is used before using angle-based functions such as $\sin$ or $\cos$.

Let's say $\theta=45$. The terminal point is then located at $(\cos(45), \sin(45))$, which gives us $(0.707, 0.707)$ (same as $\left( \frac{\sqrt{ 2 }}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{ 2 }}{2} \right)$).

Let's say $\theta=55$. The terminal point is then located at $(\cos(55), \sin(55))$, which gives us $(0.57, 0.82)$.
