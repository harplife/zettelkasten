## The Domain of an Algebraic Expression

A <mark class="hltr-trippy">Fractional Expression</mark> refers to a quotient of two algebraic expressions.

Example of fractional expressions :
- $\frac{2x}{x-1}$
- $\frac{y-2}{y^2+3}$
- $\frac{x^3-x}{x^2-5x+6}$
- $\frac{x}{\sqrt{ x^2+1 }}$

A <mark class="hltr-trippy">Rational Expression</mark> is a fractional expression in which both the numerator and the denominator are polynomials.
