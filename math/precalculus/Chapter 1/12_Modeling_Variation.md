## (extra) Variations

A <mark class="hltr-trippy">Variation</mark> is a relationship between two variables where one increases or decreases proportionally as the other increases or decreases.

A variation is described using an equation, which in this case, is called a <mark class="hltr-trippy">variation model</mark>.

Here's how variations are phrased and what they mean :

| Phrase                                            | Meaning            |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| "$y$ varies directly as $x$"                      | $y = kx$           |
| "$y$ varies inversely as $x$"                     | $y = \frac{k}{x}$  |
| "$y$ varies jointly as $x$ and $z$"               | $y = kxz$          |
| "$y$ varies directly as $x$ and inversely as $z$" | $y = \frac{kx}{z}$ |

Note that $k$ is a **constant of variation**; a fixed number that makes the equation true for the situation.

There are four types of variations :
1. Direct Variation
2. Inverse Variation
3. Joint Variation
4. Combined Variation


## Direct Variation

<mark class="hltr-trippy">Direction Variation</mark> describes the relationship where one quantity is a constant multiple of the other.

Direct variation is phrased as :

> For some constant $k \neq 0$,
> 1) $y$ varies directly as $x$
> 2) $y$ is directly proportional to $x$
> 3) $y$ is proportional to $x$

which, as an equation looks like this :

$$
y = kx
$$

where $k$ is the **constant of proportionality**.

> [!important] Proportionality is represented by $\propto$ (\\propto).
> $y \propto x$ means "$y$ changes in proportion to $x$", which can be rewritten as $y=kx$.


## Inverse Variation

<mark class="hltr-trippy">Inverse Variation</mark> describes the relationship between two variables where, as one variable increases, the other decreases proportionally, such that their product remains a constant value.

Inverse variation is phrased as :

> For some constant $k \neq 0$,
> 1) $y$ varies inversely as $x$
> 2) $y$ is inversely proportional to $x$

which, as an equation looks like this :

$$
y = \frac{k}{x} \quad or \quad x \cdot y = k
$$

where $k$ is the **constant of proportionality**.


## Combining Different Types of Variation

### Joint Variation

<mark class="hltr-trippy">Joint Variation</mark> describes the relationship between three variables, where one variable is directly proportional to the other two variables.

Joint variation is phrased as :

> For some constant $k \neq 0$,
> 1) $z$ is proportional to the product of $x$ and $y$
> 2) $z$ varies jointly as $x$ and $y$
> 3) $z$ is jointly proportional to $x$ and $y$

which, as an equation looks like this :

$$
y = kxz
$$

where $k$ is the **constant of proportionality**.


### Combined Variation

<mark class="hltr-trippy">Combined variation</mark> describes the relationship between three variables, where one variable is directly proportional to one variable and inversely proportional to the other variable.

Combined variation is phrased as :

> For some constant $k \neq 0$,
> 1) $z$ is proportional to $x$ and inversely proportional to $y$
> 2) $z$ varies directly as $x$ and inversely as $y$

which, as an equation looks like this :

$$
y = \frac{kx}{z}
$$

where $k$ is the **constant of proportionality**.


> [!example] Newton's Law of Gravity
> Newton's Law of Gravity says that two objects with masses $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$ attract each other with a force $F$ that is jointly proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance $r$ between the objects.
> 
> $$F=G\frac{m_{1}m_{2}}{r^2}$$

> [!tip] Inverse Square Laws
> Like the Law of Gravity, many laws of nature are *inverse square laws*. There is a geometric reason for this. Imagine a force or energy originating from a point source and spreading its influence equally in all directions, like a light source or the gravitational force exerted by a planet. The influence of the force or energy at a distance $r$ from the source is spread out over the surface of a sphere of radius $r$, which has area $A=4\pi r^2$. So the intensity $I$ at a distance $r$ from the source is the source strength $S$ divided by the area $A$ of the sphere :
> $$I = \frac{S}{4\pi r^2}=\frac{k}{r^2}$$
> where $k$ is the constant $\frac{S}{(4\pi)}$. Thus point sources of light, sound, gravity, electromagnetic fields, and radiation must all obey inverse square laws, simply because of the geometry of space.
