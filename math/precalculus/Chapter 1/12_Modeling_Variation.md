# 1.12 Modeling Variation

## Key Concepts

- Direct Variation
- Inverse Variation
- Combining Different Types of Variation


## (extra) Variations

A <mark class="hltr-trippy">Variation</mark> is a relationship between quantities that change together.
- When one variable changes, the other changes in a predictable way.

A variation is described using an equation, which in this case, is called a <mark class="hltr-trippy">variation model</mark>.

Here's how variations are phrased and what they mean :

| Phrase                                            | Meaning            |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| "$y$ varies directly as $x$"                      | $y = kx$           |
| "$y$ varies inversely as $x$"                     | $y = \frac{k}{x}$  |
| "$y$ varies jointly as $x$ and $z$"               | $y = kxz$          |
| "$y$ varies directly as $x$ and inversely as $z$" | $y = \frac{kx}{z}$ |

Note that $k$ is a **constant of variation**; a fixed number that makes the equation true for the situation.

There are four types of variations :
1. Direct Variation
2. Inverse Variation
3. Joint Variation
4. Combined Variation


## Direct Variation

<mark class="hltr-trippy">Direction Variation</mark> describes the relationship where one quantity is a constant multiple of the other.

---

Direct variation is phrased as :

> $y$ varies directly as $x$

which, as an equation looks like this :

$$
y = kx
$$

where $k \neq 0$ is a constant.

---

All this means is that as $x$ increases, $y$ increases proportionally. If $x$ doubles, $y$ doubles.
