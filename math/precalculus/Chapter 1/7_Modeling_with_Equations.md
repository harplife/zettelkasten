## Making and Using Models

A <mark class="hltr-trippy">Mathematical Model</mark> is an equation that describes a real-world object or process.

A simple guideline for modeling with equations :
1. Identify the Variable
2. Translate from Words to Algebra
3. Set Up the Model
4. Solve the Equation (and Check your Answer)


## Problems About Interest

When you borrow money from a bank or when a bank “borrows” your money by keeping it for you in a savings account, the borrower in each case must pay for the privilege of using the money. The fee that is paid is called **interest**.

The most basic type of interest is **simple interest**, which is just an annual percentage of the total amount borrowed or deposited.

The amount of a loan or deposit is called the **principal** $P$.

The annual percentage paid for the use of this money is the **interest rate** $r$.

We will use the variable $t$ to stand for the number of years that the money is deposited (or borrowed) and the variable $I$ to stand for the total interest earned (or paid).

The following simple interest formula gives the amount of interest $I$ when a principal $P$ is deposited (or borrowed) for $t$ years at an interest rate $r$ :

$$
I = Prt
$$

> [!warning] Remember to convert $r$ from a percentage to a decimal.


### Example : Interest on an Investment

An amount of \$100,000 is invested in two certificates of deposit. One certificate pays 6% and the other pays 4.5% simple interest annually. If the total interest is \$5,025 per year, how much money is invested at each rate?

1. Identify the variable

Let $x$ be the amount invested at 6%.

---

2. Translate from words to algebra

| In Words                | In Algebra        |
| ----------------------- | ----------------- |
| Amount invested at 6%   | $x$               |
| Amount invested at 4.5% | $100000-x$        |
| Interest earned at 6%   | $0.06x$           |
| Interest earned at 4.5% | $0.045(100000-x)$ |

---

3. Set up the model

$$
0.06x + 0.045(100000-x) = 5025
$$

---

4. Solve for $x$

$$
\begin{align}
  0.06x + 4500 - 0.045x &= 5025 \\
  0.015x + 4500 &= 5025 \\
  0.015x &= 525 \\
  x &= \frac{525}{0.015} \\
  x &= 35000
\end{align}
$$

So $35,000 is invested at 6% and the remaining $65,000 at 4.5%.


## Problems About Area or Length

Basic formulas from geometry comes handy when it comes to dealing with problems such solving for an area, a perimeter, or length of a side.

### Example : Dimensions of a Garden

A square garden has a walkaway 3 ft wide around its outer edge. If the area of the entire garden, including the walkway, is 18,000 ft², what are the dimensions of the planted area?
