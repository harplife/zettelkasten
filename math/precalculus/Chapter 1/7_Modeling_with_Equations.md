## Making and Using Models

A <mark class="hltr-trippy">Mathematical Model</mark> is an equation that describes a real-world object or process.

A simple guideline for modeling with equations :
1. Identify the Variable
2. Translate from Words to Algebra
3. Set Up the Model
4. Solve the Equation (and Check your Answer)


## Problems About Interest

When you borrow money from a bank or when a bank “borrows” your money by keeping it for you in a savings account, the borrower in each case must pay for the privilege of using the money. The fee that is paid is called **interest**.

The most basic type of interest is **simple interest**, which is just an annual percentage of the total amount borrowed or deposited.

The amount of a loan or deposit is called the **principal** $P$.

The annual percentage paid for the use of this money is the **interest rate** $r$.

We will use the variable $t$ to stand for the number of years that the money is deposited (or borrowed) and the variable $I$ to stand for the total interest earned (or paid).

The following simple interest formula gives the amount of interest $I$ when a principal $P$ is deposited (or borrowed) for $t$ years at an interest rate $r$ :

$$
I = Prt
$$

> [!warning] Remember to convert $r$ from a percentage to a decimal.


### Example : Interest on an Investment

An amount of \$100,000 is invested in two certificates of deposit. One certificate pays 6% and the other pays 4.5% simple interest annually. If the total interest is \$5,025 per year, how much money is invested at each rate?

---

1. Identify the variable

Let $x$ be the amount invested at 6%.

---

2. Translate from words to algebra

| In Words                | In Algebra        |
| ----------------------- | ----------------- |
| Amount invested at 6%   | $x$               |
| Amount invested at 4.5% | $100000-x$        |
| Interest earned at 6%   | $0.06x$           |
| Interest earned at 4.5% | $0.045(100000-x)$ |

---

3. Set up the model

$$
0.06x + 0.045(100000-x) = 5025
$$

---

4. Solve for $x$

$$
\begin{align}
  0.06x + 4500 - 0.045x &= 5025 \\
  0.015x + 4500 &= 5025 \\
  0.015x &= 525 \\
  x &= \frac{525}{0.015} \\
  x &= 35000
\end{align}
$$

So $35,000 is invested at 6% and the remaining $65,000 at 4.5%.


## Problems About Area or Length

Basic formulas from geometry comes handy when it comes to dealing with problems such solving for an area, a perimeter, or length of a side.

### Example : Dimensions of a Garden

A square garden has a walkaway 3 ft wide around its outer edge. If the area of the entire garden, including the walkway, is 18,000 ft², what are the dimensions of the planted area?

---

1. Identify the variable

Let $x$ be the length of the planted area.

---

2. Translate from words to algebra


| In Words                | In Algebra |
| ----------------------- | ---------- |
| Length of planted area  | $x$        |
| Length of entire garden | $x+6$      |
| Area of entire garden   | $(x+6)^2$  |

---

3. Set up the model

$$
(x+6)^2 = 18000
$$

---

4. Solve for $x$

$$
\begin{align}
  x + 6 &= \sqrt{ 18000 } \\
  x &= \sqrt{ 18000 } - 6 \\
  x &\approx 128
\end{align}
$$

The planted area of the garden is about $128$ ft by $128$ ft.


### Example : Dimensions of a Building Lot

A rectangular building lot is 8 ft longer than it is wide and has an area of 29000 ft². Find the dimensions of the lot.

---

1. Identify the variable

Let $w$ be the width of lot

---

2. Translate from words to algebra

| In Words      | In Algebra |
| ------------- | ---------- |
| Width of lot  | $w$        |
| Length of lot | $w+8$      |

---

3. Set up the model

$$
w(w+8) = 2900
$$

---

4. Solve for $w$

$$
\begin{align}
  w^2 + 8w &= 2900 \\
  w^2 + 8w - 2900 &= 0 \\
  (w-50)(w+58) &= 0 \\
  w &= 50, -58
\end{align}
$$

Since the width of the lot must be a positive number, $w = 50$. The length of the lot is $w+8=58$.


### Example : Dimensions of a Building

A person needs to find the height of a certain four-story building and observes that the shadow of the building is 28 ft long. The person is 6 ft tall and has a shadow 3.5 ft long when standing next to the building. How tall is the building?

![[Pasted image 20250929161113.png| center | 500]]

---

1. Identify the variable

Let $h$ be the height of the building.

---

2. Translate from words to algebra

| In Words                                  | In Algebra      |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Height of building                        | $h$             |
| Ratio of height to shadow of the building | $\frac{h}{28}$  |
| Ratio of height to shadow of the person   | $\frac{6}{3.5}$ |

---

3. Set up the model

$$
\frac{h}{28} = \frac{6}{3.5}
$$

---

4. Solve for $h$

$$
h = \frac{6 \cdot 28}{3.5} = 48
$$

The building is 48 ft tall.


## Problems About Mixtures

Problems involving mixtures and concentrations make use of the fact that if an amount $x$ of a substance is dissolved in a solution with volume $V$, then the concentration $C$ of the substance is given by :

$$
C = \frac{x}{V}
$$

Note that in many mixture problems the concentration $C$ is expressed as a percentage. It is important to convert it to decimal form in order to make calculations.
