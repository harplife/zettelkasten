## Integer Exponents

A product of identical numbers is usually written in *exponential notation*.

<mark class="hltr-trippy">Exponential Notation</mark> is defined as follows :

---

If $a$ is any real number and $n$ is a positive integer, then the $n$th power of $a$ is
$$
a^n = a \times a \times \dots \times a
$$

The number $a$ is called the <mark class="hltr-trippy">base</mark>, and $n$ is called the <mark class="hltr-trippy">exponent</mark>.

---

> [!note] The number of times the base repeats is called the $n$ *factor*.
> For example, $(5 \times 5 \times 5)$ has 3 factors.
