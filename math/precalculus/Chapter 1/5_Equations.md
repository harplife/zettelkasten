## Equations and Equalities

An <mark class="hltr-trippy">Equation</mark> is a mathematical statement that says two expressions are equal. It always has an equals sign $=$.

Examples :
- $2+3=5$
- $x^2+2x+1=0$
- $\sin{\theta}=\frac{1}{2}$

An equation can be true, false, or conditionally true depending on the value(s) of the variable(s).
- $2+3=5$ --> always true
- $x+2 = 5$ --> true only when $x = 3$
- $x+2 = x+3$ --> never true

The <mark class="hltr-trippy">Solution Set</mark> of an equation is the set of all values of the variable(s) that make the equation true.
- For $x+2 =5$, the solution set is $\{ 3 \}$
- For $x^2=4$, the solution set is $\{ -2, 2 \}$

> [!important] The solution set is also referred to as the **Solutions** or **Roots**.

> [!important] The process of finding the solutions is called **solving the equation**.


### Types of Equations

- Linear Equation : $2x+3=7$
- Quadratic Equation : $x^2-4=0$
- Polynomial Equation : $x^4+x^3-2=0$
- Rational Equation : $\frac{1}{x+1}=\frac{2}{x}$
- Trigonometric Equation : $\sin{\theta}=\cos{\theta}$
- Exponential Equation : $2^x=8$
- Logarithmic Equation : $\log(x)=2$


### Equivalent Equations

The <mark class="hltr-trippy">Equivalent Equations</mark> refer to two equations with exactly the same solutions.

> [!important] Most of precalculus is about *manipulating equations into simpler equivalent forms* so they are solvable.

Equivalent equations has a couple of properties.

| Property                | Equation                           |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Addition Property       | $A=B \iff A+C=B+C$                 |
| Multiplication Property | $A=B \iff CA=CA$, given $C \neq 0$ |

> [!note] Addition property is basically subtraction property, as multiplication is division.
