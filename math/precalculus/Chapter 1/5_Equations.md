## Equations and Equalities

An <mark class="hltr-trippy">Equation</mark> is a mathematical statement that says two expressions are equal. It always has an equals sign $=$.

Examples :
- $2+3=5$
- $x^2+2x+1=0$
- $\sin{\theta}=\frac{1}{2}$

An equation can be true, false, or conditionally true depending on the value(s) of the variable(s).
- $2+3=5$ --> always true
- $x+2 = 5$ --> true only when $x = 3$
- $x+2 = x+3$ --> never true

The <mark class="hltr-trippy">Solution Set</mark> of an equation is the set of all values of the variable(s) that make the equation true.
- For $x+2 =5$, the solution set is $\{ 3 \}$
- For $x^2=4$, the solution set is $\{ -2, 2 \}$

> [!important] The solution set is also referred to as the **Solutions** or **Roots**.

> [!important] The process of finding the solutions is called **solving the equation**.


### Types of Equations

- Linear Equation : $2x+3=7$
- Quadratic Equation : $x^2-4=0$
- Polynomial Equation : $x^4+x^3-2=0$
- Rational Equation : $\frac{1}{x+1}=\frac{2}{x}$
- Trigonometric Equation : $\sin{\theta}=\cos{\theta}$
- Exponential Equation : $2^x=8$
- Logarithmic Equation : $\log(x)=2$


### Equivalent Equations

The <mark class="hltr-trippy">Equivalent Equations</mark> refer to two equations with exactly the same solutions.

> [!important] Most of precalculus is about *manipulating equations into simpler equivalent forms* so they are solvable.

Equivalent equations has a couple of properties.

| Property                | Equation                           |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Addition Property       | $A=B \iff A+C=B+C$                 |
| Multiplication Property | $A=B \iff CA=CA$, given $C \neq 0$ |

> [!note] Addition property is basically subtraction property, as multiplication is division.


## Solving Linear Equations

The <mark class="hltr-trippy">Degree</mark> of an equation is determined by the highest power of the variable (with a nonzero coefficient) in the equation, after it's simplified.

The simplest type of equation is a <mark class="hltr-trippy">Linear Equation</mark>, or first-degree equation.

The general form of linear equations :

$$
ax + b = 0, \quad a \neq 0
$$

Both $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, and $x$ is the variable.

Examples of linear equations :
- $4x-5=3$
- $2x=\frac{1}{2}x-7$
- $x-6=\frac{x}{3}$

Solving a linear equation usually involves moving all terms (with variable $x$) to one side and all constant terms on the other.

For example,

$$
\begin{align}
  7x-4 &= 3x+8 \\
  7x &= 3x +8 + 4 \\
  7x &= 3x + 12 \\
  7x - 3x &= 12 \\
  4x &= 12 \\
  4x \cdot \frac{1}{4} &= 12 \cdot \frac{1}{4} \\
  x &= 3
\end{align}
$$


## Formulas

A <mark class="hltr-trippy">Formula</mark> is a special type of equation that shows the relationship between different variables.
- It's not usually meant to be solved for one specific variable (like a normal equation might be).
- Instead, it expresses how one quantity depends on others.

In other words, a formula is an equation that represents a rule or relationship between quantities.

Example of formulas :
- $A = \pi r^2$ (area of a circle)
- $V = \pi r^2h$ (volume of a cylinder)
- $F = ma$ (Newton's 2nd law)
- $m = \frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}$ (slope)


## Solving Quadratic Equations

The <mark class="hltr-trippy">Quadratic Equation</mark>, or second-degree equation, generally takes the following form :

$$
ax^2 + bx + c = 0, \quad a \neq 0
$$

$a$, $b$, and $c$ are real numbers and $x$ is the variable.
