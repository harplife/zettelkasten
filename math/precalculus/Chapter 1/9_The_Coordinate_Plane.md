## The Coordinate Plane

The <mark class="hltr-trippy">Coordinate Plane</mark> (aka **Cartesian Plane**) is a flat, two-dimensional surface used to graphically represent relationships between two variables (usually $x$ and $y$).

> [!note] The Cartesian Plane was named after the French mathematician Rene Descartes (Latinized as Cartesius), who (in 17th century) developed the idea of representing algebraic equations as geometric curves.
> Another Frenchman, Pierre Fermat, also invented the principles of coordinate geometry at the same time.

The Cartesian plane consists of two number lines that intersect at right angles :
- The horizontal line is the x-axis, which represents the independent variable (the input).
- The vertical line is the y-axis, which represents the dependent variable (the output).

The point where these two axes intersect is called the origin, denoted by $O(0,0)$.

Each point in the Cartesian plane is represented by an ordered pair $(x, y)$, where :
- $x$ tells how far to move horizontally, left if negative and right if positive.
- $x$ tells how far to move vertically, up if positive and down if negative.

The axes divide the plane into four regions called <mark class="hltr-trippy">Quadrants</mark>, labeled counter-clockwise :

|Quadrant|Sign of (x)|Sign of (y)|
|:--|:--|:--|
|**I**|+|+|
|**II**|−|+|
|**III**|−|−|
|**IV**|+|−|

The Cartesian plane allows the visualization of algebraic equations as geometric figures :

| Equation type     | Shape on the Cartesian plane |
| :---------------- | :--------------------------- |
| $y = 2x + 1$      | Straight line                |
| $x^2 + y^2 = 9$   | Circle                       |
| $y = x^2$         | Parabola                     |
| $y = \frac{1}{x}$ | Hyperbola                    |
