A Real Number is a number that can be used to measure a continuous one-dimensional quantity.

The set of real numbers, sometimes called "the reals", is traditionally denoted by a bold R or blackboard bold R.

The adjective real, used in the 17th century by Rene Descartes, distinguishes real numbers from imaginary numbers (e.g. $\sqrt{ -1 }$).
