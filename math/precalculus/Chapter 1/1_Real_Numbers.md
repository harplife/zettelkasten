A <mark class="hltr-trippy">Real Number</mark> is a number that can be used to measure a continuous one-dimensional quantity.

The set of real numbers, sometimes called "the reals", is traditionally denoted by a bold $R$ or blackboard bold $\mathbb{R}$.

The adjective *real*, used in the 17th century by **Rene Descartes**, distinguishes real numbers from imaginary numbers (e.g. $\sqrt{ -1 }$).

The real numbers include both the *rational numbers* $\mathbb{Q}$ and the *irrational numbers*.

A rational number is a number that can be expressed as a quotient of two integers.

A real number x is rational if and only if there exist integers a and b with b != 0 such that x = a/b.

The rational numbers include the integers, which includes the whole numbers, which then includes the natural numbers.

The irrational numbers include the algebraic numbers and the transcendental numbers.
