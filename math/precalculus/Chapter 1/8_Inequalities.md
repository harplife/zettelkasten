## Solving Linear Inequalities

### Inequality

An **equation** is made up of two algebraic expressions that are equal to each other; the two expressions are separated by the equal $=$ sign, and each expression is referred to as either the left-hand-side, or the right-hand-side depending on where they locate in respect to the equal sign.

An <mark class="hltr-trippy">Inequality</mark> looks just like an equation, except that in the place of the equal sign is one of the symbols of $<$, $>$, $\leq$, or $\geq$. For example, $4x+7 \leq 19$ is an inequality.

To **solve an inequality** that contains a variable means to find all values of the variable that makes the inequality true.
- Unlike an equation, an inequality generally has infinitely many solutions, which form an interval or a union of intervals on the real line.

### Rules for Inequalities

| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| $A \leq B \iff A+C \leq B+C$                                          | **Adding/subtracting** the same quantity to each side of an inequality gives an equivalent inequality.                         |
| If $C>0$, then $A\leq B \iff CA \leq CB$                              | **Multiplying** each side of an inequality by the same positive quantity gives an equivalent inequality                        |
| If $C<0$, then $A \leq B \iff CA \geq CB$                             | **Multiplying** each side of an inequality by the same negative quantity *reverses the direction* of the inequality.           |
| If $A>0$ and $B>0$, then $A \leq B \iff \frac{1}{A} \geq \frac{1}{B}$ | **Taking reciprocals** of each side of an inequality involving positive quantities *reverses the direction* of the inequality. |
| If $A \leq B$ and $C \leq D$, then $A+C \leq B + D$                   | Inequalities can be added.                                                                                                     |
| If $A \leq B$ and $B \leq C$, then $A \leq C$                         | Inequality is transitive.                                                                                                      |


### Linear Inequality

An inequality is <mark class="hltr-trippy">Linear</mark> if each term is constant or a multiple of the variable. In other words, the degree of the expressions on both sides has to be $1$.

Solving a linear inequality is similar to solving an equation. For example,

$$
\begin{align}
  3x &< 9x + 4 \\
  3x - 9x &< 9x + 4 - 9x \\
  -6x &< 4 \\
  \left( -\frac{1}{6} \right)(-6x) &> \left( -\frac{1}{6} \right)(4) \\
  x &> -\frac{2}{3}
\end{align}
$$

The solution of the inequality above is the interval $\left( -\frac{2}{3}, \infty \right)$.


### Simultaneous Inequalities

Solving inequalities can become a little complex when there are multiple inequalities all at the same time - in other words, <mark class="hltr-trippy">Simultaneous Inequalities</mark>. It looks like this :

$$
A < B + C < D
$$

Solving inequalities :

$$
\begin{align}
  4 &\leq 3x - 2 < 13 \\
  4+2 &\leq 3x -2 +2 < 13+2 \\
  6 &\leq 3x < 15 \\
  6\left( \frac{1}{3} \right) &\leq 3x\left( \frac{1}{3} \right) < 15\left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \\
  2 &\leq x < 5
\end{align}
$$

The solution set is $\{ x \in \mathbb{R} \mid 2 \leq x < 5 \} = [2, 5)$.
