## Solving Inequalities

An **equation** is made up of two algebraic expressions that are equal to each other; the two expressions are separated by the equal $=$ sign, and each expression is referred to as either the left-hand-side, or the right-hand-side depending on where they locate in respect to the equal sign.

An <mark class="hltr-trippy">Inequality</mark> looks just like an equation, except that in the place of the equal sign is one of the symbols of $<$, $>$, $\leq$, or $\geq$. For example, $4x+7 \leq 19$ is an inequality.

To **solve an inequality** that contains a variable means to find all values of the variable that makes the inequality true.
- Unlike an equation, an inequality generally has infinitely many solutions, which form an interval or a union of intervals on the real line.

### Rules for Inequalities

| $A \leq B \iff A+C \leq B+C$                                          | **Adding/subtracting** the same quantity to each side of an inequality gives an equivalent inequality.                         |
| If $C>0$, then $A\leq B \iff CA \leq CB$                              | **Multiplying** each side of an inequality by the same positive quantity gives an equivalent inequality                        |
| If $C<0$, then $A \leq B \iff CA \geq CB$                             | **Multiplying** each side of an inequality by the same negative quantity *reverses the direction* of the inequality.           |
| If $A>0$ and $B>0$, then $A \leq B \iff \frac{1}{A} \geq \frac{1}{B}$ | **Taking reciprocals** of each side of an inequality involving positive quantities *reverses the direction* of the inequality. |
| If $A \leq B$ and $C \leq D$, then $A+C \leq B + D$                   | Inequalities can be added.                                                                                                     |
