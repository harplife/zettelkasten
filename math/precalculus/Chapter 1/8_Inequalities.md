## Solving Inequalities

An **equation** is made up of two algebraic expressions that are equal to each other; the two expressions are separated by the equal $=$ sign, and each expression is referred to as either the left-hand-side, or the right-hand-side depending on where they locate in respect to the equal sign.

An <mark class="hltr-trippy">Inequality</mark> looks just like an equation, except that in the place of the equal sign is one of the symbols of $<$, $>$, $\leq$, or $\geq$. For example, $4x+7 \leq 19$ is an inequality.

To **solve an inequality** that contains a variable means to find all values of the variable that makes the inequality true.
- Unlike an equation, an inequality generally has infinitely many solutions, which form an interval or a union of intervals on the real line.
