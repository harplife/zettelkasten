A <mark class="hltr-trippy">variable</mark> is a letter than can represent any number from a given set of numbers.

An <mark class="hltr-trippy">Algebraic Expression</mark> is a mathematical phrase that combines numbers, variables, and operations.

> [!note] If there is an equals sign ($=$), that's an **equation**, not an expression.

A <mark class="hltr-trippy">Term</mark> is a single piece of an algebraic expression, made of :
- A number (coefficient)
- Variable(s) with **positive** **integer** exponent(s)
- Multiplication between them

Terms are separated by $+$ or $-$.

> [!note] A <mark class="hltr-trippy">Coefficient</mark> is any number that is multiplied with a variable.
> In the expression $2x^2 - 3x + 4$, there are two coefficients :
> - $2$
> - $-3$

For example, take this expression :

$$
7x^2y - 3y +5
$$

In the above expression, there are three terms :
- $7x^2y$
- $-3y$
- $5$

A <mark class="hltr-trippy">Monomial</mark> is an expression with only one term (e.g. $5x$).

A <mark class="hltr-trippy">Binomial</mark> is an expression with two terms (e.g. $x + 1$).

A <mark class="hltr-trippy">Trinomial</mark> is an expression with three terms (e.g. $x^2 + x + 1$).

An expression can have many terms, and an expression with one or more terms is generally referred to as a <mark class="hltr-trippy">Polynomial</mark>.
