## Fundamental Theorem of Algebra and Complete Factorization

---
The <mark class="hltr-trippy">Fundamental Theorem of Algebra</mark> states that for every polynomial

$$
P(x) = a_{n}x^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\cdots+a_{1}x+a_{0} \quad (n \geq 1,a_{n} \neq 0)
$$

with complex coefficients has at least **one complex zero**.

In other words, there is at least one root $r \in \mathbb{C}$ such that $P(r)=0$ .

> [!important] Because any real number is also a complex number, the theorem applies to polynomials with *real* coefficients as well.

---
The <mark class="hltr-trippy">Complete Factorization Theorem</mark> is *corollary* (direct consequence) of the FTA, which states that every polynomial $P(x)$ of degree $n \geq 1$ with complex coefficients can be completely factored into $n$ linear factors over the complex numbers. That is,

$$
P(x) = a_{n}(x-r_{1})(x-r_{2})\dots(x-r_{n})
$$

where $r_{1}, r_{2}, \dots, r_{n}$ are the **complex zeros** (some possibly repeated).
