## Fundamental Theorem of Algebra and Complete Factorization

---
The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra states that for every polynomial

$$
P(x) = a_{n}x^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\cdots+a_{1}x+a_{0} \quad (n \geq 1,a_{n} \neq 0)
$$

with complex coefficients has at least **one complex zero**.

In other words, there is at least one root $r \in \mathbb{C}$ such that $P(r)=0$ .

> [!important] Because any real number is also a complex number, the theorem applies to polynomials with *real* coefficients as well.
