## The Rational Function $f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$

A <mark class="hltr-trippy">Rational Function</mark> is any function that can be written as the ratio of two polynomials :

$f(x)=\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$

where $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ are polynomials, and $Q(x) \neq 0$ .

> [!example] $f(x)=\frac{x^2-1}{x-2}$ is a rational function.

Just like how $f(x)=x^2$ is the base for quadratics, $f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$ acts as the base for reciprocal functions of the form :

$$
g(x)=\frac{a}{x-h}+k
$$

where :
- $h$ causes the horizontal shift
- $k$ causes the vertical shift
- $a$ causes the stretch or flip

> [!warning] This applies only to any function of degree $1$ over degree $1$.

The graph of a function $f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$ looks like this :

As it can be seen from the graph, $f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$ has these properties :
- $f(x)$ approaches positive infinity as $x$ approaches $0$, if $x > 0$
- $f(x)$ approaches $0$ as $x$ approaches positive infinity
- $f(x)$ approaches negative infinity as $x$ approaches $0$, if $x < 0$
- $f(x)$ approaches $0$ as $x$ approaches negative infinity

> [!example] $g(x)=\frac{2}{x-3}+1$
> This function can be described with transformations from the base $f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$ :
> - Shift right $3$
> - Shift up $1$
> - Stretch by a factor of $2$


## Vertical and Horizontal Asymptotes

An <mark class="hltr-trippy">Asymptote</mark> is a line that a graph approaches but never actually touches (or only touches once, in special cases).

It describes the behavior of a function when :
- $x$ gets very large (positive or negative), or
- $x$ gets close to a value that makes the function "blow up" (like dividing by zero)

There are three types of asymptotes :
- Vertical Asymptotes
- Horizontal Asymptotes
- Oblique (Slant) Asymptotes

A <mark class="hltr-trippy">Vertical Asymptote</mark> is a vertical line $x=a$ where the function value goes to infinity or negative infinity.
