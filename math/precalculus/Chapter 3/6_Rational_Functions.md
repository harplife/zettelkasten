## The Rational Function $f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$

A <mark class="hltr-trippy">Rational Function</mark> is any function that can be written as the ratio of two polynomials :

$f(x)=\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$

where $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ are polynomials, and $Q(x) \neq 0$ .

For example, $f(x)=\frac{x^2-1}{x-2}$ is a rational function.

Properties and key features of a rational function :

| Feature                               | Description                                               | How to Find It                                          |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Domain**                            | All real $x$ where $Q(x) \ne 0$                           | Solve $Q(x) = 0$                                        |
| **Intercepts**                        | Where graph crosses x-axis and y-axis                     | **x-intercept:** where $P(x)=0$; **y-intercept:** $x=0$ |
| **Vertical Asymptotes**               | Places where function “blows up” to $\infty$ or $-\infty$ | Solve $Q(x)=0$ (if not canceled)                        |
| **Holes (Removable Discontinuities)** | Where numerator and denominator share a factor            | Simplify $P/Q$, and see where cancellation occurs       |
| **Horizontal Asymptote**              | The behavior as $x \to \infty$ or $x \to -\infty$         | Compare degrees of $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$                    |
| **Oblique (Slant) Asymptote**         | When degree of $P(x)$ is one more than $Q(x)$             | Found by polynomial long division                       |
| **End Behavior**                      |                                                           |                                                         |
