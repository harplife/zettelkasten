## The Rational Function $f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$

A <mark class="hltr-trippy">Rational Function</mark> is any function that can be written as the ratio of two polynomials :

$f(x)=\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$

where $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ are polynomials, and $Q(x) \neq 0$ .

> [!example] $f(x)=\frac{x^2-1}{x-2}$ is a rational function.

Just like how $f(x)=x^2$ is the base for quadratics, $f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$ acts as the base for reciprocal functions of the form :

$$
g(x)=\frac{a}{x-h}+k
$$

where :
- $h$ causes the horizontal shift
- $k$ causes the vertical shift
- $a$ causes the stretch or flip

The graph of a function $f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$ looks like this :

As it can be seen from the graph, $f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$ has these properties :
- $f(x)$ approaches positive infinity as $x$ approaches $0$, if $x > 0$
- $f(x)$ approaches $0$ as $x$ approaches positive infinity
- $f(x)$ approaches negative infinity as $x$ approaches $0$, if $x < 0$
- $f(x)$ approaches $0$ as $x$ approaches negative infinity

> [!example] $g(x)=\frac{2}{x-3}+1$
> This function can be described with transformations from the base $f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$ :
> - Shift right $3$
> - Shift up $1$
> - Stretch by a factor of $2$







Properties and key features of a rational function :

| Feature                               | Description                                               | How to Find It                                          |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Domain**                            | All real $x$ where $Q(x) \ne 0$                           | Solve $Q(x) = 0$                                        |
| **Intercepts**                        | Where graph crosses x-axis and y-axis                     | **x-intercept:** where $P(x)=0$; **y-intercept:** $x=0$ |
| **Vertical Asymptotes**               | Places where function “blows up” to $\infty$ or $-\infty$ | Solve $Q(x)=0$ (if not canceled)                        |
| **Holes (Removable Discontinuities)** | Where numerator and denominator share a factor            | Simplify $P/Q$, and see where cancellation occurs       |
| **Horizontal Asymptote**              | The behavior as $x \to \infty$ or $x \to -\infty$         | Compare degrees of $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$                    |
| **Oblique (Slant) Asymptote**         | When degree of $P(x)$ is one more than $Q(x)$             | Found by polynomial long division                       |
| **End Behavior**                      |                                                           |                                                         |
