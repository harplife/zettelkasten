## Polynomial Functions

A <mark class="hltr-trippy">Polynomial Function</mark> of degree $n$ is a function of the form

$$
P(x) = a_{n}x^{n} + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \dotsi + a_{1}x + a_{0}
$$

where $n$ is a non-negative integer and $a_{n} \neq 0$.

The number $a_{n}x^n$ is the <mark class="hltr-trippy">Leading Term</mark>.

The numbers $a_{0}, a_{1}, a_{2}, \dots, a_{n}$ are called the <mark class="hltr-trippy">Coefficients</mark> of the polynomial.

The number $a_{n}$ (the coefficient of the highest power) is the <mark class="hltr-trippy">Leading Coefficient</mark>.

The number $a_{0}$ is the <mark class="hltr-trippy">Constant Coefficient</mark> or **Constant Term**.

If a polynomial consists of just a single term, then it is called a **monomial**.
