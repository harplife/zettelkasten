## Polynomial Inequalities

> [!important] Refer to [[8_Inequalities#Solving Nonlinear Inequalities|Chapter 1.8]] for solving nonlinear inequalities.

Solving polynomial inequalities like $P(x) \geq 0$ involves the following steps :

1. Move all terms to one side (so that the other side is $0$)
2. Factor completely
3. Find the intervals determined by the real zeros
4. Test each interval for sign
5. Determine the solutions of the inequality

For example, solving for $2x^3+x^2+6 \geq 13x$ looks like the following.

1. Move all terms to one side

$$
\begin{align}
  2x^3+x^2+6 &\geq 13x \\
  2x^3+x^2-13x+6 &\geq 0
\end{align}
$$

2. Factor completely

Given $2x^3+x^2-13x+6$, we use the Rational Zero Theorem to find the candidates for $\frac{p}{q}$ . The factors of $p$ are $\pm\{ 1,2,3,6 \}$, where as the factors of $q$ are $\pm\{ 1,2 \}$. Thus, we have the candidates

$$
\pm \left\{  1, \frac{3}{2},2,3,6  \right\}
$$
