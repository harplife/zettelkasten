## Polynomial Inequalities

> [!important] Refer to [[8_Inequalities#Solving Nonlinear Inequalities|Chapter 1.8]] for solving nonlinear inequalities.

Solving polynomial inequalities like $P(x) \geq 0$ involves the following steps :

1. Move all terms to one side (so that the other side is $0$)
2. Factor completely
3. Find the intervals determined by the real zeros
4. Test each interval for sign
5. Determine the solutions of the inequality
