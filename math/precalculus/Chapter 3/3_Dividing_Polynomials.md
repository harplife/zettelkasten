## Long Division of Polynomials

<mark class="hltr-trippy">Polynomial Long Division</mark> is a method used to divide one polynomial (the *dividend*) by another polynomial (the *divisor*), finding both the *quotient* and the *remainder*.

Given $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, a polynomial long division $\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$ looks like this :

$$
\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}=q(x)+\frac{r(x)}{g(x)}
$$

where :
- $f(x)$ is the dividend
- $g(x)$ is the divisor
- $q(x)$ is the quotient
- $r(x)$ is the remainder
- The degree of $r(x)$ is always less than the degree of $g(x)$


Given $f(x)=x^3-3x+2$ and $g(x)=x-1$, a polynomial long division is used to solve :
