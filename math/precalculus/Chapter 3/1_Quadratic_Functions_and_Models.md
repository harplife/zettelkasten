# 3.1 Quadratic Functions and Models

## Key Concepts

- Graphing Quadratic Functions Using the Vertex Form
- Maximum and Minimum Values of Quadratic Functions
- Modeling with Quadratic Functions


## Graphing Quadratic Functions Using the Vertex Form

The graph of any quadratic function $f(x)=ax^2+bx+c$ is a <mark class="hltr-trippy">Parabola</mark>; it can be obtained from the graph of $f(x)=x^2$ by applying a transformation.

Reminder that the quadratic function can be expressed in the vertex form :

$$
f(x)=a(x-h)^2+k
$$

$(h,k)$ represents the vertex of the parabola, and
- If $a>0$, the parabola opens upward
- If $a<0$, the parabola opens downward


## Maximum and Minimum Values of Quadratic Functions

Given the vertex form of a quadratic function $f(x)=a(x-h)^2+k$,
- If $a>0$, then the minimum value of $f$ is $f(h)=k$
- If $a<0$, then the maximum value of $f$ is $f(h)=k$

In other words, the vertex is the minimum value if the parabola opens upward, and otherwise the maximum value (opens downward).

> [!reminder] The standard form of a quadratic function can be converted to the vertex form.
> $$f(x)=ax^2+bx+c=a\left( x+\frac{b}{2a} \right)^2+c-\frac{b^2}{4a}$$
> In this form, $h=-\frac{b}{2a}$ and $k=c-\frac{b^2}{4a}$


## Modeling with Quadratic Functions

> [!example] Maximum Gas Mileage for a Car
> **Problem**
> Most cars get their best gas mileage when traveling at relatively modest speeds. The gas mileage $M$ for a certain new car is modeled by the function $$M(s)=-\frac{1}{28}s^2+3s-31 \quad 15 \geq s \geq 70$$
> where $s$ is the speed in mi/h and $M$ is measured in mi/gal.
> 
> The car's best gas mileage, and what speed is it attained?
> 
> **Solution**
> The function $M$ is a quadratic function with $a=-\frac{1}{28}$ and $b=3$. Thus its maximum value occurs when $$s=-\frac{b}{2a}=-\frac{3}{2\left( -\frac{1}{28} \right)}=42$$
> The maximum value is $M(42)=-\frac{1}{28}(42)^2+3(42)-31=32$. So the car's best gas mileage is $32$ mi/gal when it is traveling at $42$ mi/h.
