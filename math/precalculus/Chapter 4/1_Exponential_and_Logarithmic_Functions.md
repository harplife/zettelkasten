## Exponential Functions

An <mark class="hltr-trippy">Exponential Function</mark> is a function where the variable is in the exponent :

$$
f(x) = a \cdot b^x
$$

where :
- $a$ is a nonzero constant (vertical scale/shift factor)
- $b$ is the base, which must be positive and not equal to $1$

Examples :
- $2^x$
- $5 \cdot 3^x$
- $0.5^x$
- $-4 \cdot 1.2^x$

> [!warning] If $b<0$, the function oscillates and becomes undefined for many real $x$.

> [!warning] If $b=1$, then $1^x=1$, which is not exponential growth or decay, it's contant.

Exponential functions are divided into two main families : Growth and Decay.

<mark class="hltr-trippy">Exponential Growth</mark> occurs when $b>1$. This function rapidly increases as $x \to \infty$ and approaches $0$ as $x \to -\infty$.

Exponential Decay occurs when $0 < b < 1$. This function rapidly decreases as $x \to \infty$ and approaches $0$ as $x \to -\infty$.
