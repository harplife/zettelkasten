## Logarithmic Functions

A L<mark class="hltr-trippy">ogarithmic Function</mark> is the inverse of an exponential function.

Given an exponential with base $a$ :

$$
y = a^x
$$

where $a>0$ and $a \neq 1$, its inverse function is :

$$
x = \log_{a}(y)
$$

Intuitively, a logarithm tells us what exponent we need to get a certain number.

For example, a log of $8$ with base $2$ tells us that we need exponent $3$ :

$$
\begin{align}
  \log_{2}(8) &= 3 \\
  2^3 &= 8
\end{align}
$$
