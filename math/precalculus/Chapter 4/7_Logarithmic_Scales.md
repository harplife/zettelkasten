- The Decibel Scale


## The pH Scale

The <mark class="hltr-trippy">pH scale</mark> is a scale that measures how **acidic** or **basic** a solution is. Specifically, it measures the **concentration of hydrogen ions** in a solution.

The pH is defined as :

$$
pH=-\log[H^{+}]
$$

Where :
- $H^{+}$ is the Hydrogen ions
- $[H^{+}]$ means concentration ($[H^{+}]<1$) of Hydrogen ions (moles per liter)
- The logarithm is in base 10

> [!important] The negative sign flips the direction of the scale.
> Because $[H^{+}]<1$, its logarithm is negative. We want the scale to be in positive numbers, so the negative sign is used to flip the sign.

> [!important] Pure water is $7$ on the pH scale - which is considered neutral.
> This means that solutions that have $ph<7$ are *acidic*, and $ph>7$ are *basic*. The pH scale generally ranges from $0$ to $14$, but extremely strong acids or bases can technically have pH values outside this range.

> [!important] Given pH, using the inverse can find the concentration.
> $$[H^{+}]=10^{-pH}$$

Hydrogen ion concentrations can vary many orders of magnitude. The typical values are :
- $1$ mol/L
- $10^{-7}$ mol/L
- $10^{-14}$ mol/L

In which case, the logarithm helps by :
- Compressing huge ranges into small numbers
- Turning multiplicative changes into additive ones

> [!important] Logs turn multiplication into addition.
> A change of pH scale by $1$ means the solution is $10$ times more acidic/basic. In other words, multiplying $[H^{+}]$ by $10$ is the same as subtracting $1$ from pH, and dividing by $10$ is the same as adding $1$.
