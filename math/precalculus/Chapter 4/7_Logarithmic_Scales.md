## The pH Scale

The <mark class="hltr-trippy">pH scale</mark> is a scale that measures how **acidic** or **basic** a solution is. Specifically, it measures the **concentration of hydrogen ions** in a solution.

The pH is defined as :

$$
pH=-\log[H^{+}]
$$

Where :
- $H^{+}$ is the Hydrogen ions
- $[H^{+}]$ means concentration ($[H^{+}]<1$) of Hydrogen ions (moles per liter)
- The logarithm is in base 10

> [!important] The negative sign flips the direction of the scale.
> Because $[H^{+}]<1$, its logarithm is negative. We want the scale to be in positive numbers, so the negative sign is used to flip the sign.

> [!important] Pure water is considered neural on the pH scale.
> Pure water has $[H^{+}]=10^{-7}$, meaning $pH=7$.
> 
> This means that solutions that have $ph<7$ are *acidic*, and $ph>7$ are *basic*.

> [!important] Given pH, using the inverse can find the concentration.
> $$[H^{+}]=10^{pH}$$

Hydrogen ion concentrations can vary many orders of magnitude. The typical values are :
- $1$ mol/L
- $10^{-7}$ mol/L
- $10^{-14}$ mol/L

In which case, the logarithm helps by :
- Compressing huge ranges into small numbers
- Turning multiplicative changes into additive ones

A change of pH scale by $1$ means the solution is $10$ times more acidic/basic. For example, pH 6 is 10x more acidic than pH7, and 100x more acidic than pH8.
