# 2.4 Average Rate of Change of a Function

## Key Concepts

- Average Rate of Change
- Linear Functions Have Constant Rate of Change

## Average Rate of Change

The <mark class="hltr-trippy">Average Rate of Change</mark> of the function $y=f(x)$ between $x=a$ and $x=b$ is

$$
\text{average raet of change} = \frac{\text{change in } y}{\text{change in } x} = \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}
$$

A <mark class="hltr-trippy">Secant Line</mark> is the straight line that passes through two points on a function's graph :

$$
(x_{1},f(x_{1})) \text{ and } (x_{2},f(x_{2}))
$$

The **slope of the secant line** equals the average rate of change between those two points.

$$
m_{\text{secant}} = \frac{f(x_{2})-f(x_{1})}{x_{2}-x_{1}}
$$

> [!example] The Average Velocity
> If $s(t)$ represents your position at time $t$, then $$\frac{s(t_{2})-s(t_{1})}{t_{2}-t_{1}}$$ is your **average velocity**; how far you traveled divided by how much time passed.

> [!tip] In Calculus, we study how functions change at an *instantaneous* level- that is, at a single point, not over an interval (average).


## Linear Functions Have Constant Rate of Change

The slope $m$ is the <mark class="hltr-trippy">Constant Rate of Change</mark> in a linear function $f(x)=mx+b$. This means that, no matter the input(s), the average speed of change will remain the same (constant).
