# 2.4 Average Rate of Change of a Function

## Key Concepts

- Average Rate of Change
- Linear Functions Have Constant Rate of Change

## Average Rate of Change

The <mark class="hltr-trippy">Average Rate of Change</mark> of the function $y=f(x)$ between $x=a$ and $x=b$ is

$$
\text{average raet of change} = \frac{\text{change in } y}{\text{change in } x} = \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}
$$

The average rate of change is the slope of the secant line between $x=a$ and $x=b$ on the graph of $f$, that is, the line that passes through $(a,f(a))$ and $(b,f(b))$.
