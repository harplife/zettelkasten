## Vertical Shifting

Adding a constant to a function shifts its graph vertically.

Suppose $c>0$,
- $y=f(x)+c$ shifts the graph of $y=f(x)$ upward $c$ units
- $y=f(x)-c$ shifts the graph of $y=f(x)$ downward $c$ units

In case of a linear function $f(x)=mx+b$, the constant $b$ moves the graph vertically.

In case of a quadratic function $f(x)=a(x-h)^2+k$, the constant $k$ moves the graph vertically.


## Horizontal Shifting

Adding a constant to a function input shifts its graph horizontally.

Suppose $c>0$,
- $y=f(x-c)$ shifts the graph of $y=f(x)$ to the right $c$ units
- $y=f(x+c)$ shifts the graph of $y=f(x)$ to the left $c$ units

> [!important] It's kind of confusing to see this effect when dealing with a linear function, because shifting vertically has the same effect as shifting horizontally.

With a quadratic function, such as $f(x)=x^2$, adding a constant to the input $f(x+c)$ is the same as $f(x)=(x+c)^2$.

> [!important] Call it a revelation, but in a way, it's easier to understand any quadratic function as some sort of a modification of $f(x)=x^2$.
> Also, the modification can be done on either input or the output.


## Reflecting Graphs
