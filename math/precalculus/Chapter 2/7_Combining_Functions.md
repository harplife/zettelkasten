## Sums, Differences, Products, and Quotients

Functions can be combined to create a *new function*. There are four basic ways it can be done so, which are :
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

To summarize,

| Operation          | Notation                      | Rule                                   |
| :----------------- | :---------------------------- | :------------------------------------- |
| **Addition**       | $(f + g)(x)$                  | $f(x) + g(x)$                          |
| **Subtraction**    | $(f - g)(x)$                  | $f(x) - g(x)$                          |
| **Multiplication** | $(fg)(x)$                     | $f(x) \times g(x)$                     |
| **Division**       | $\left(\frac{f}{g}\right)(x)$ | $\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$, given$g(x) \ne 0$ |

> [!important] When combining functions, the domain of the new function is limited to all $x$ that are in the domain of both $f$ and $g$, except when division-by-zero occurs.
> Let $f$ and $g$ be functions with domains $A$ and $B$. The domain of the new function is $A \cap B$.


## Composition of Functions

Beyond simple arithmetic, functions can be combined by feeding one function into another - which is called <mark class="hltr-trippy">Composition of Functions</mark>. It looks like this :
