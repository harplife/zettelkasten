## One-to-One Functions : The Horizontal Line Test

A function is called a One-to-One Function if no two elements in its domain have the same image, that is,

$$
f(x_{1}) \neq f(x_{2}) \text{ whenever } x_{1} \neq x_{2}
$$

If a **horizontal line** intersects the graph of $f$ at more than one point, then the function $f$ is not a one-to-one function.

Basically, any function that has symmetry about the y-axis is *not* a one-to-one function. Meanwhile, any linear function is a one-to-one function.

Examples of one-to-one function :
- $f(x)=x$
- $f(x)=x^3$
- $f(x)=\frac{1}{x}$
- $f(x)=\sqrt{ x }$

Examples of NOT one-to-one function :
- $f(x)=x^2$
- $f(x)=x^4$


## The Inverse of a Function

Let $f$ be a one-to-one function with domain $A$ and range $B$. Then its inverse function $f^{-1}$ is defined by :

$$
f^{-1}(y) = x \iff f(x)=y
$$

for any $y$ in $B$,
