#### Note
- A constant term can be regarded as a coefficient because it can be thought of as a number multiplied by a variable with a power of two. For example, $8$ is the same thing as $8x^0$. The degree of this polynomial is $0$, and the coefficient is $8$ (as shown in Page 28).
- For polynomials with more than one variable, the **degree of a term** is the sum of the exponents of the variables in the term. For example, in polynomial $3x^2y^5+8xy^3$, the first term $3x^2y^5$ has degree of $2+5=7$. The degree of the second term is $1+3=4$.
- For polynomials with more than one variable, the **degree of the polynomial** is the highest degree of its terms. For instance, the degree of the polynomial $3x^2y^5+8xy^3$ is the degree of its first term, which is $7$.
- For polynomials with more than one variable, the **leading coefficient** is the coefficient of the highest-degree term. For instance, the degree of leading coefficient polynomial $3x^2y^5+8xy^3$ is the coefficient of the first term, which is $3$.
