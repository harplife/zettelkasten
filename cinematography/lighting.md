### Key Light

### Fill Light

### Backlight
- In [lighting design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lighting_design), [backlighting](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backlighting_(lighting_design)>) is the process of illuminating a subject from the back, creating a glowing outline of the subject.
- Backlighting is a main component of the traditional three-point-lighting technique and is what makes a frame feel three-dimensional rather than flat. When a backlight hits a subject at an angle it is referred to as a kicker or rim light.
- Backlight is used for creating depth, defining shape, reducing flatness, increasing dramatic effect, and separating a subject from the background.
