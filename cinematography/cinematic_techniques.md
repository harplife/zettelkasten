## 180-degree rule
- [180-degree rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/180-degree_rule) is a basic guideline regarding the on-screen spatial relationship between an object and another object within a scene (including characters).
- Another description : 180-degree rule is a continuity editorial technique in which sequential shots of two or more actors within a scene are all shot with the camera on one side of the two actors so that a coherent spatial relationship and [eyeline match](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyeline_match) are maintained.
- The rule states that the camera should be kept on one side of an imaginary axis between two objects, so that the first object is always frame right of the second character.
- ![[180_degree_rule.svg|300]]
- The applied 180-degree rule is an essential element for a style of film editing called [Continuity Editing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_editing).
- **Reverse Cut** refers to a shot following an earlier shot in a sequence which is located on the opposite side of the 180-degree line. Reverse cuts disorient the viewer by presenting an opposing viewpoint of the action in a scene, and consequently altering the perspective of the action and the spatial orientation esbalished in the original shot.

### Breaking the rule
- Moving the camera over the axis (breaking the 180-degree rule) is called *Jumping the Line* or *Crossing the Line*.
- Breaking the 180-degree rule disorients the viewer, and sometimes a filmmaker purposely breaks the 180-degree rule to create the disorientation.
- Example : Passion of Joan of Arc (Carl Theodor Dreyer)
- Example : The Shining (Stanley Kubrick)

## Airborne shot
- A shot taken from an aerial device, generally while moving. This technique has gained popularity in recent years due to the popularity and growing availability of drones.
- Other names : Aerial View, Bird's eye view shot, God's eye view shot, Overhead Shot, Elevated Shot, Raised Shot

## Arc
- A dolly shot where the camera moves in an arc along a circular or elliptical radius in relation to the subject ("arc left" or "arc right")

## Bridging shot
- A Bridging Shot is a shot that connects two different, disconnected moments in a film. It is often used to cover a jump in time or place or other discontinuity.
- Examples are a clock face showing advancing time, falling calendar pages, railroad wheels, newspaper headlines and seasonal changes.
- Bridge shots are also used to avoid jump cuts when inserting a [pick-up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pick-up_(filmmaking) "Pick-up (filmmaking)").

## High-angle shot
- A [High-angle shot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-angle_shot) is a shot where the camera looks down on the subject from a high angle and the point of focus often gets "swallowed" up.
- High-angle shots can make the subject seem vulnerable or powerless when applied with the correct mood, setting, and effects.

## Low-angle shot
- A [Low-angle shot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-angle_shot) is a shot positioned low on the vertical axis, anywhere below the eye line, loking up.
- Low-angle shots can make the subject seem strong and powerful.

## Cross-cutting
- Def 1 : [Cross-cutting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-cutting) is an editing technique used to establish action occurring at the same time, and often in the same place.
- Def 2 : **Cross Cutting** in film is an editing technique that cuts separate actions together to illustrate moments that take place simultaneously within the narrative structure.
- The “rules” of cross cutting as far as their relation to scale and time are not overly strict, but the majority of cross cuts are used to show large scale events that occur across multiple locations.
- Parallel Editing is a specific cross cutting technique that creates a narrative parallel that the viewer may compare and contrast.
- Cross Cutting can be used to show actions across multiple locations, show actions that occur simultaneously, and/or create a narrative parallel to compare and contrast.
- [studiobinder.com | What is Cross Cutting / Parallel Editing](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/cross-cutting-parallel-editing-definition/)

### Example : Inception
This cross cutting example shows actions that occur simultaneously and combine to build more suspenseful scenes.

We begin in the first dream layer, with Yusuf behind the wheel of a van carrying the team, including Arthur. We see a motorcycle approaching from behind which begins a chase scene in dream layer one.
![[What-is-Cross-Cutting-Dream-Layer-1.jpg.webp]]
(Dream Layer #1)

We get our first cross cut to the second dream layer as Arthur can feel something is wrong in the above dream layer. Because these cuts are sequential, we automatically know that the actions of the above layer are directly affecting the second dream layer.
![[Dream-Layer-Cross-Cutting.jpg.webp]]
(Dream Layer #2)

_Inception_ is a very specific case where the actions create direct changes in the other dream layers. But this could be the same as someone cutting the power to a building, and the effect across multiple locations.
![[Inception-Layer-1-Cross-Cutting-Editing.jpg.webp]]

Through the use of cross cutting, we experience the suspense caused by the assault on the van as well as the fight between Arthur and the security forces that takes place in the second dream level.

## Continuity Editing
- [Continuity editing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_editing) is the process, in film and video creation, of combining more-or-less related shots, or different components cut from a single shot, into a sequence to direct the viewer's attention to a pre-existing consistency of story across both time and physical location.
- The **goal of continuity editing** is to make the mechanisms of filmmaking invisible as to help the audience dismiss disbelief more easily.
- Continuity editing is also referred to as **Three-Dimensional Continuity**.
- [studiobinder.com | What is Continuity Editing](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-continuity-editing-in-film/)
- Techniques of CE include Eye Line, Eye Trace, [[#180-degree rule]], and Matching Action.

## Deep Focus
- [Deep Focus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_focus) is a technique in which objects in the extreme foreground and objects in the extreme background are kept equally in focus. In other words, it allows the Cinematographer to keep everything in perspective without favoring foreground, mid-ground, or background. Everything is lit and visible.
- When deep focus is used, filmmakers often combine it with **Deep Space** (also called deep staging).
- **Deep Space** is a part of _[mise-en-scène](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise-en-sc%C3%A8ne "Mise-en-scène")_, placing significant actors and props in different planes of the picture. A film utilizes Deep Space when significant elements of an image are positioned both near to and distant from the camera.
- The opposite of deep focus is [Shallow Focus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shallow_focus).

## Dissolve
- A Dissolve is a type of [film transition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_transition) in which one sequence fades over another. In other words, it is a gradual transition in which one shot fades out as the next shot fades, resulting a moment of time where both shots overlap.
- #todo not sure if there is difference between **Dissolve** and **Lap Dissolve**, or they are the same?
- [studiobinder.com | What is a Lap Dissolve](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-a-lap-dissolve-definition/)

## Camera Dolly
- A [Camera Dolly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_dolly) is a wheeled cart or similar device used to create smooth horizontal camera movements.
- The camera is mounted to the dolly, and the camera operator and focus puller or camera assistant usually ride on the dolly to push the dolly back and forth.
- The [Dolly Grip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolly_grip) is the dedicated technician trained to operate the dolly by manually pushing it back and forth.

### Dolly Shot
- A [Tracking Shot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracking_shot) is any shot where the camera follows backward, forward or moves alongside the subject being recorded. It is called Dolly Shot when the camera is mounted on a dolly.
