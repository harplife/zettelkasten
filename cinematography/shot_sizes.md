# Shot Sizes
- [Shot size](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/types-of-camera-shots-sizes-in-film/) is how much of the setting of the setting or subject is displayed within a given frame of a video, photo, or animation, hence the scope or size of the shot.
- Different types of camera shots in film or video communicate different narrative value, and are combined during post-production to tell a story.
- Most filmmakers use standard names for shot sizes, often abbreviated into 2 or 3 letters on a shot list or storyboard. For example, a close up shot would be abridged to "CU," or a wide shot would be denoted as "WS."
