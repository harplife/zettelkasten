### Course Description

- The calculus sequence is designed for students whose area of concentration is mathematics, science, or engineering.
- The SWIC Mathematics faculty believes calculus students must become aware of the advances in technology and its uses in mathematics, particularly in calculus. Therefore, computer technology is integrated in the calculus sequence through the use of the Mathematica software package.
- Students are also required to use graphing calculators, as recommended by the instructor, on some assignments and/or tests.
- It is recommended that any calculus sequence be completed in the college in which it was begun. However, if a student transfers during the sequence, the student is urged to discuss the calculus entry level with the math department of the transfer school.
- The MATH 203 course content includes limits of functions, derivatives, extrema of functions, tangents, asymptotes, definite and indefinite integrals, differentiation and integration of transcendental functions, and applications of calculus in physical science and engineering.


### Course Objectives

> [!important] According to the instructor, Calculus I will cover mainly limits, derivatives, and integration (intro).

1. Determine the equation of a line tangent to a curve at a point (x, y)
2. Connect the concepts of a derivates and instantaneous rate of change
3. Explain the difference between average and instantaneous rate of change
4. Write the limit definition of a derivative
5. Use the definition to find derivatives of functions
6. Apply the power rule, product rule, and quotient rules to determine derivatives

#### Applications of Differentiation

1. Compute linear approximations and differentials of functions
2. State L'Hôpitals Rule and find limits for indeterminate forms, including exponential, using L'Hôpitals Rule
3. Find absolute/relative extrema on closed and open intervals
4. Determine when a function is increasing/decreasing without graphing aids
5. Determine the concavity of a function without graphing aids
6. Sketch curves including extrema and points of inflection
7. Apply the principles of Calculus to real situations and find optimal solutions
8. Apply derivatives to determine how quantities fluctuate in various real-world applications


#### Integration

1. Write Riemann sums that approximate areas and write the integral that would represent the exact area
2. Explain the concept of signed area
3. Explain the basic properties of integration
4. Explain the fundamental relationship between area and antiderivatives
5. Explain the connection between integration and differentiation
6. Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to solve problems
7. Calculate the average value of a function and explain why this represents an average
8. Integrate using the technique of substitution

## Notes

### Week 1 (01/12~01/16)

< About the instructor >

Dr. Jaime Manche (제이미 맨치) is an enthusiastic character with bright personality, who prefers to have high engagement with students.

She is very knowledgeable in mathematics, and she has an excellent communication skills to convey such knowledge. She knows how to communicate in a way that levels with the students, and she makes sure that the students understand what she's talking about.
- She first started out as an English teacher at grade school. Then, she found her passion in mathematics. She prefers teaching at university level because students are more enthusiastic.

She fashions a huge green Stanley cup. Also, she has both engagement ring and wedding ring on - which are both silver, and the wedding ring has a huge square crystal (diamond, I suppose). It's kind of funny to see those rings appear on the digital blackboard (projection from her desk).

Her voice is very articulate, and so is her handwriting.

< About the students >

The Three Chatty Girls
- I think their names are Ace, Max, and Sam. But it needs confirmation.
- They switch their seats in rotation every day.
- One of them likes to collect figurines.
- One of them has three cats.
- One of them likes Pokemon (unsure)

The Messy Girl in Front
- She always shows up in a hoodie, which is almost always wrinkled.
- Her hair is messy.

The Pianist On the Right
- He's pretty much my math partner, as we are encouraged to check answers with each other.
- He seems to struggle even with basic algebra, so I don't understand why he's taking Calculus.

The Night Shift Guy
- He is always very VERY tired.

The Loud and Proud Gamer Guy
- He's quick to answer, he's correct most of the time, and he has a booming mid-tone voice.
- He likes gaming, wants to do career related to gaming, but he thinks the game development career is unstable so he's considering just teaching at grade school.

The Identical Twins
- The most identical looking twins I've ever seen.

< About Calculus >

According to Dr. Manche :
- Algebra is required for Calculus I
- Trigonometry is required for Calculus II
- Point-Slope Form is important in Calculus III because it adapts to 3-dimension.

< General Note >

- According to Dr. Manche, entering decimals in HWs can be tedious. We're encouraged to contact her if decimal points become an issue.
- #todo I should learn how to use the TI-84 Calculator.
