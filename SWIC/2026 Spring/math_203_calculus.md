### Course Description

- The calculus sequence is designed for students whose area of concentration is mathematics, science, or engineering.
- The SWIC Mathematics faculty believes calculus students must become aware of the advances in technology and its uses in mathematics, particularly in calculus. Therefore, computer technology is integrated in the calculus sequence through the use of the Mathematica software package.
- Students are also required to use graphing calculators, as recommended by the instructor, on some assignments and/or tests.
- It is recommended that any calculus sequence be completed in the college in which it was begun. However, if a student transfers during the sequence, the student is urged to discuss the calculus entry level with the math department of the transfer school.
- The MATH 203 course content includes limits of functions, derivatives, extrema of functions, tangents, asymptotes, definite and indefinite integrals, differentiation and integration of transcendental functions, and applications of calculus in physical science and engineering.


### Course Objectives

> [!important] According to the instructor, Calculus I will cover mainly limits, derivatives, and integration.
> This is equivalent to Chapter 2~5 in the textbook.
