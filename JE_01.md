## Thoughts on "The Internet is Worse Than Ever - Now What?" by Kurzgesagt
This [video](https://youtu.be/fuFlMtZmvY0?si=aD_BD58yW-kZYXpJ) covers "Political Violence on the web" and explains what may be causing it.

It's not particularly a feel-good video. It raises awareness of the effects of the internet on the society, at best. The fact that the video ends with an ad about Ground News makes me feel deceived, not to mention it made me question the intention and the validity of the content.

### Good
- I learned about [[filter_bubble|Filter Bubble]]. Looking it up helped me understand it more, and also reminded me of "Echo Chamber".
 - Kurzgesagt states that Filter Bubble is a myth, because one is exposed to more people and consequently more diverse opinions online than offline.
	 - I found this statement to be full of shit, but I see the positive in the fact that it made me think about it.
 - I've ended up spending over an hour on;
	 - really trying to understand the point of the content
	 - researching to validate/invalidate the arguments found in the video
	 - writing about the experience of watching the video and what followed afterwards
- It's twice now that I've heard about Ground News within this week, as an ad placed at the end of a Youtube video. This realization led me to think about the frequency of the Ads Disguised As Content, and overall merit of the content that serves as one.

### Bad
- The counter-argument against Filter Bubble in this video is bad; it can hardly count as one, and it seems more like a counter-argument against Echo Chamber (being a real threat online).
- I've ended up making a comment on the video, and I don't feel too great about it. I want it there so people can think about it, but I also don't want to be frustrated by trolls or anything negative. The comment goes,
	- I think you are mistaking your counter-argument against Filter Bubble with one against Echo Chamber. Also, the so-called "research" that you talk about is not even peer reviewed. Maybe before you parade around with unproven facts and nonsensical arguments that you call content, you should consider making a content called "The Dangers of using Fear Tactics in Marketing (Feat. Kurzgesagt)".
- The Ads Disguised As Content is really distasteful. Although there might be a few good points still left in the video, I've become unwilling to spend any more mental effort to dissect the content.
- I can't help but think that the content was basically a Fear-based Advertising. The video states that Political Violence exists (and it affects us negatively), and this service helps us free ourselves from it.
