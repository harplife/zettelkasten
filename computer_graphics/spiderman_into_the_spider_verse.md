		- **Joshua Beveridge (Animation Supervisor)** : "That day the teaser trailer came out was a really cathartic, amazing day. We'd worked on this for already a year and a half by the time it came out. The world hadn't seen any of it, and some of the things we were trying to do felt like risks, and we thought there were too many. We thought the majority of the people might hate it. We thought it was divisive."
