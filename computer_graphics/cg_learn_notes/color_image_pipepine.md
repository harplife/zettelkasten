# What is Color Image Pipeline
An __image pipeline__ or __video pipeline__ is the set of components commonly used for performing any intermediate digital image processing between an image source (e.g. camera) and an image renderer (e.g. monitor).

Typical components include,
- image sensor corrections (i.e. [[color_filter_array|Color Filter Array]])
- [noise reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_reduction)
- [image scaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scaling)
- [gamma correction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_correction)
- image enhancement
- color space conversion (e.g RGB to YCbCr)
- [chroma subsampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroma_subsampling) (basically what JPEG does)
- [image compression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_compression)
- data transmission and storage


Here's an example of a color image pipeline.
