## Size
In 2017 in USA (which at the time represented about 1/3 of the global video game market), the [Entertainment Software Association (ESA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Software_Association) estimated that there were over 2,300 development companies and over 525 publishing companies. These companies in total had nearly 66,000 direct employees (source - wiki).

## Value Chain
Traditionally, the video game industry has had six connected layers in its [value chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_chain) based on the retail distribution of games (source - wiki):
1. Game Development
2. Publishing
3. Distribution
4. Retail
5. Consumer
6. Hardware platform

As games have transitioned from the retail to more digital market, parts of this value chain have become redundant.

### Game Developer
A [video game developer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_developer) is a broad term for a software developer (a person or a company) specializing in video game development.

There are 3 types of developers:
1. First-Party Developer
2. Second-Party Developer
3. Third-Party Developer (+ indie game developer)

#### First-Party Developer
A **First-Party Developer** is a subsidiary/division of a video game console manufacturer and develops exclusively for the console.
- May the name of the company itself (e.g. Nintendo), with a specific division name (e.g. Sony's Polyphony Digital).
- Independent studios may get acquired by the console manufacturer.
- Main examples (as of 2023) include PlayStation Studios (Sony) and XBOX Game Studios (MS).
- May be referred to as **In-House Developer**.

#### Second-Party Developer
A **Second-Party Developer** is a developer that takes development contract from a platform holder and develop games exclusive to that platform (but is not owned by the platform holder).
- As a balance to not being able to release their game for other platforms, 2PDs are offered higher royalty rates than 3PDs.

#### Third-Party Developer
A Third-Party Developer is a developer that either 1) develop & publish its own game, or 2) works together with a publisher to release its game.
- The business arrangement between the developer and publisher is governed by a contract, which specifies a list of milestones intended to be delivered over a period of time.
- Both publisher and developer have considerable input in the game's design and content. However, the publisher's wishes generally override those of the developer.
- Usually not bound to a specific console/platform.

##### Indie Game Developer
An Indie Game Developer (indie stands for independent) is a developer not owned/contracted by a single publisher.
- Has complete control over the game development.
- Often lacks money for marketing.

## Roles
The development side of the industry is made up of six connected and distinctive layers (source - wiki):
1. Capital and Publishing
2. Product and Talent
3. Production and Tools
4. Distribution/Publishing
5. Hardware/Software Platform
6. End-User
