## Research
- During rendering, all objects in the scene are brightened with the specified intensity and color.
- This type of light source is mainly used to provide the scene with a basic view of the different objects in it.
- This is the simplest type of lighting to implement, and models how light can be scattered or reflected many times, thereby producing a uniform effect.
- It can be combined with [[ambient_occlusion|Ambient Occlusion]] to represent how exposed each point of the scene is, affecting the amount of ambient light it can reflect.
	- This produces diffused, non-directional lighting throughout the scene, casting no clear shadows, but with enclosed and sheltered areas darkened.
	- The result is usually visually similar to an overcast day.
