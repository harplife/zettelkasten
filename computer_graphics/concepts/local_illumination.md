## Definition
- [Local Illumination (Object Oriented Lighting) | wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_graphics_lighting#Object_oriented_lighting) : An illumination model that approximates lighting effects by mapping an object to a single light source (a light source may be mapped to N objects tho, I think).
