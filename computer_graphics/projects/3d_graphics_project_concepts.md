Creating spheres with glass/water-like transparency that show a "feature" within. Much like the glass art that I'm used to seeing back in Carbondale / Makanda.

## Concept - The Moirai
Creating features that carry a theme of "probability/prediction/AI" by using symbolisms and characters that are derived from the "Fate (Moira in greek)" sisters from the greek/roman mythology.

The Fates(Moirai) were often personified as three old women who spin the threads of human destiny;
- Klotho/Nona (The Spinner) : spins the thread of human fate
- Lachesis/Decuma (The Allotter) : dispenses the thread?
- Atropos/Morta (The Inflexible) : cuts the thread (determination of death)
