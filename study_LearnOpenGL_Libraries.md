# Setting Up Libraries
- First thing to do before drawing anything with OpenGL is to create an OpenGL context and an application window to draw in.
	- These are operations that are specific per operating system, and OpenGL itself does not provide these operations.
	- It is up to the developers to create a window, define a context, and handle user input.
- There are a few libraries that provide such functionalities, some specifically aimed at OpenGL.
	- Some of the more popular libraries are GLUT, SDL, SFML and GLFW.
- GLFW library is used on the LearnOpenGL course.
- Additionally, GLAD library is used to locate OpenGL functions.

## GLFW
- GLFW is a library specifically targeted at OpenGL.
- GLFW provides the bare necessities required for rendering to the screen, such as creating an OpenGL context, defining window parameters, and handling user input.

## Building GLFW
- Download GLFW (64-bit) source code from http://www.glfw.org/download.html
- Although GLFW does come pre-compiled, it is better to compile in the system for better compatibility.
- The items that are to be used are:
	- The resulting library from compilation
	- The `include` folder
- Not everyone uses the same setups for their project, which means that the project/solution files need to be converted to match the setup it is to be used in. CMake is the tool that is used specifically for that purpose.

### CMake
- CMake is a tool that can generate project/solution files of the user's choice from a collection of source code files using pre-defined CMake scripts.
- Download CMake from http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html
- Convert GLFW project files using CMake:
	1. Extract GLFW source code zip file.
	2. Open CMake
	3. Choose the root folder of GLFW source code as the source code folder.
	4. Create a few folder `build` inside the root folder, and select it as the build target folder.
	5. Click the Configure button, then choose the generator (an IDE of choice, Visual Studio) on the configure window.
	6. Click Finish to configure.
	7. Leave the options as default, then click Generate to compile.
	8. Check to see that the resulting project files are created inside the build folder.

### Compilation
- Once the project files are converted using CMake, a project file `GLFW.sln` can be found inside the build folder. Open it with Visual Studio and proceed to build (compile).
- Compiled library `glfw3.lib` can be found in `build/src/Debug` folder.
- There are two approaches to using third party libraries:
	- Add the library to the IDE's `/lib` folder.
	- (Recommended) Set a location (i.e. `C://cpp_libraries`) where all the header files/libraries from third party libraries are to be stored at. Create `/include` folder and `/lib` folder.
- Move files from GLFW's `/include` folder to third party libaries `/include` folder.
- Move `glfw3.lib` to third party libraries `/lib` folder.

## First Project
- Create an empty project with Visual Studio.
- Make sure the debug mode is set to `x64`.

## Linking
- In order for the project to use GLFW, the library needs to be linked with the project.
- This can be done by specifying `glfw3.lib` in the linker settings.
	- The project does not yet know where to find `glfw3.lib` because third party libraries are stored in a different directory. This directory needs to be added to the project first.
- Project Libraries Configuration:
	1. Right-click the project name in the solution explorer, and then click on `properties` on the right click menu.
	2. On the Property Pages window, select `VC++ Directories`.
	3. Edit `Library Directories` to add `/lib` folder. Edit `Include Directories` to add `/include` folder.

	4. Under `Linker` > `Input`, edit `Additional Dependencies` by adding `glfw3.lib`.

### OpenGL library on Windows
- On Windows, `opengl32.lib` comes with the Microsoft SDK (which is installed by default with VS).
- Add `opengl32.lib` to the linker settings.
- (note) according to this [SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/63121201), linking `opengl32.lib` may not be necessary because GLAD loads it during runtime. However, there are conflicting information that says not linking may result in errors during compilation - so, let's just link it to be safe.

## GLAD
- Different GPUs come with different versions of OpenGL drivers, which means location of most of its functions is not known at compile-time and needs to be queried at run-time.
- It is the task of the developer to retrieve the location of the functions that they need, and store them in function pointers for later use.
- Retrieving those locations is OS-specific, and it can get rather complex and cumbersome to locate functions and store them in function pointers.
- GLAD library simplifies the process of locating/storing OpenGL functions.

### Setting up GLAD
- Go to http://glad.dav1d.de/
	- Set Language to C++
	- Set Specification to OpenGL
	- Set API gl to Version 3.3
	- Set Profile to Core
	- Under Options, check Generate a loader
	- Click *Generate* to produce library files
- Download the zip file. It should contain `/include` folder and `/src` folder.
- Inside `/include` folder, there should be `glad` folder and `KHR` folder. Move them to the `C://cpp_libraries/include` folder.
- Inside `/src` folder, there is `glad.c` file. Copy & paste this to the project folder. Then, add it to the `Source Files` on Visual Studio.
- Create a file and name it `Main.cpp`. Type `#include <glad/glad.h>` and build. There should be no errors.
