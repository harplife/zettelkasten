# What is Draconian
Draconian (adjective) means (of laws or their application) excessively harsh and severe.

## Example
- Some people think Sigapore's chewing gum ban is _draconian_.
- The editorial criticizes the _draconian_ measures being taken to control the spread of the disease.

## Origin
_Draconian_ comes from _Draco_, the name of a 7th-century B.C. Athenian legislator who created a written code of law. Draco's code was intended to clarify preexistent laws, but its severity is what made it really memorable. In Draco's code, even minor offenses were punishable by death, and failure to pay one's debts could result in slavery. As a result, _Draconian_ became associated with things cruel or harsh.
