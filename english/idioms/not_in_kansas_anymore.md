# We're not in Kansas anymore

"We're not in Kansas anymore" is an idiom that means "we have stepped outside of what is considered normal; we have entered a place or circumstance that is unfamiliar and uncomfortable".

## Origin
In the 1939 movie, The Wizard of Oz, Dorothy says to her dog at one point "Toto, I've a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore".
