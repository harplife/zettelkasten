# What is Frupid
A derisive [[portmanteau|Portmanteau]] of "frugal" and "stupid", used especially within dysfunctional corporate environments where management espouses "frugality" as a virtue yet fails to distinguish between this and "cheap".

## Example

Manager: I changed your server order from 4 GB of RAM to 1 GB of RAM. It's too expensive.
Engineer: There's no way we'll be able to keep the site running only on 1 GB!
Manager: Oh, remind me to dock you for not being _frugal_ in your next performance review.
Engineer: I think you mean _frupid_.
Manager: You are fired.

# My Thoughts
I think small-medium companies always struggle with this concept of being _frugal_.
As much as I think limited resource tends to give way for _creativity_, it would be a mistake to cut corners in order to make do.

This seems especially the case for contractors; there were cases when they would skim on building materials, and the building would collapse.

I see it in software development companies too.
- Higher ups would keep the programmers busy without any idle time by assigning projects on top of another, expecting the programmers would somehow "multi-task" and complete all the projects in time. The programmers become restless and stressed.
- They would only hire jr level programmers to save costs, only to be surprised by the mediocre result. The few sr level programmers are busy helping others, rather than coding themselves (sometimes they would code everything and become overworked).

I wonder, is being frugal in business management worth it? Maybe they could come up with a better profit model so that they don't have to be frugal?

I see so many cases of people being _frupid_. I have yet to see a good example of being frugal in business management.
