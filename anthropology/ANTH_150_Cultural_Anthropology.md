### What is Cultural Anthropology?

- #def **Cultural Anthropology** : Study of the similarities and differences among living societies and cultural groups.
- #def **Culture** : A set of beliefs, practices, and symbols that are learned and shared.
- #def **Enculturation** : The process of learning the characteristics and expectations of a culture or group.

---
**Characteristics of Culture** :
- Humans are born with the capacity to learn the culture of any social group. We learn culture both directly and indirectly.
- Culture changes in response to both internal and external factors.
- Humans are not bound by culture; they have the capacity to conform to it or not, and sometimes change it.
- Culture is symbolic; individuals create and share the meanings of symbols within their group or society.
- The degree to which humans rely on culture distinguishes us from other animals and shaped our evolution.
- Human culture and biology are interrelated: Our biology, growth, and development are impacted by culture.


### Brief History of Cultural Anthropology

**Zhang Qian (164 BC - 113 BC)**
- Born in the 2nd century BCE in Hanzhong, China
- Zhang was a military officer
- Assigned by Emperor Wu of Han to travel through Central Asia, as far as what is today Uzbekistan.
- Travelled more than 25 years and recorded his observations of the peoples and cultures of Central Asia.
- Emperor Wu used his observations to establish new relationships and cultural connections with China's neighbors to the West.
- Discovered many of the trade routes used in the Silk Road.
- Introduced several new cultural ideas, including Buddhism, into Chinese culture.

**Abu Abdullah Muhammad Ibn Battuta (1304-1369)**
- Known most widely as *Ibn Battuta*.
- Iban was an Amazigh (Berber) Moroccan Muslim scholar.
- During the 14th century, he traveled nearly 30 years, covering most of the Islamic world, including parts of Europe, sub-Saharan Africa, India, and China.
- Wrote a book called *Tuhfat al-anzar fi gharaaib al-amsar wa ajaaib al-asfar* (A Gift to those who Contemplate the Wonders of Cities and the Marvels of Traveling), commonly known as *Al Rhila* (means "travels" in Arabic); he documented the customs and traditions of the people he encountered on his trip.

**The 1400s through the 1700s (aka Age of Discovery)**
- Europeans explored the world, and colonized it; exploited natural resources and human labor in other parts of the world, exerting social and political control over the people they encountered.
- New trade routes along with the slave trade fueled a growing European empire while forever disrupting previously independent cultures in the Old World.
- European *ethnocentrism* was used to justify the subjugation of non-European societies on the alleged basis that these groups were socially and even biologically inferior.
	- #def **Ethnocentrism** : The belief that one's own culture is better than others.

**The 18th Century (aka Age of the Enlightenment)**
- As European empires expanded, new ways of understanding the world and its people arose. Thus began the *Age of the Enlightenment*.
- #def **Age of the Enlightenment** : A social and philosophical movement in 18th century Europe that privileged science, rationality, and experience, while critiquing religious authority.
- #person **Sir Charles Lyell** (1797-1875), a geologist, observed layers of rock and argued that the Earth's surface must have changed gradually over long periods of time. He disputed the Young Earth theory, which was popular at the time and used Biblical information to date the Earth as only 6,000 years old.
- #person **Charles Darwin** (1809-1882), a naturalist and biologist, observed similarities between fossils and living specimens. He argued that all life is descended from a common ancestor.
- #person **John Locke** (1632-1704), a philosopher, contemplated the origins of society itself, proposing that people historically had lived in relative isolation until they agreed to form a society in which the government would protect their personal property.

**The 19th Century**
- #person **Herbert Spencer** (1820-1903), a philosopher and anthropologist, used biological evolution as a model to understand social evolution. Just as biological life evolved from simple to complex multicellular organisms, he postulated that societies "evolve" to become larger and more complex.
- #person **Lewis Henry Morgan** (1818-1881), an anthropologist, argued that all societies "progress" through the same stages of development: savagery - barbarism - civilization. Societies were classified into these stages based on their family structure, technologies, and methods for acquiring food. So-called "savage" societies, ones that used stone and foraged for food, were said to be stalled in their social, mental, and even moral development.
	- Classic ethnocentric behavior.

**The 20th Century**
- #person **Bronislaw Malinowski** (1884-1942), a Polish anthropologist, became stranded during World War I on the Trobriand Islands located north of Australia and Papua New Guinea. While there, he started to develop **participant-observation** fieldwork. By living with and observing the islanders, he realized that their culture was not "savage", but was well-suited to fulfill the needs of the people.
	- ![[Pasted image 20260123213723.png | 300]]
	- #def **Participant-Observation** : A type of observation in which the anthropologist observes while participating in the same activities in which her informants are engaged.
	- He developed a theory to explain human cultural diversity; each culture functions to satisfy the specific biological and psychological needs of its people. While this theory has been critiqued as *biological reductionism*, it was an early attempt to view other cultures in more open-minded ways.
		- #def **Biological Reductionism** : The view that complex life, behavior, or social phenomena can be fully explained by breaking them down into simpler biological components like genes, neurons, hormones, or atoms, often downplaying cultural or environmental factors. It is criticized for oversimplifying human experience, ignoring emergent properties (new properties that arise from complex interactions, not just individual parts), and possibly leading to deterministic views.
			- Conflicts with **Holism** and **Social Constructionism**.
			- Example - attributing gender roles solely to reproductive anatomy, ignoring social conditioning.
- #person **Franz Boas** (1858-1942), widely regarded as the founder of American anthropology, developed *Cultural Relativism*. In his critique of ethnocentric views, Boas insisted that physical and behavioral differences among racial and ethnic groups in the US were shaped by environmental and social conditions, not biology. He argued that human behaviors are socially learned, contextual, and flexible, not innate.
	- #def **Cultural Relativism** : The view that while cultures differ, they are not better or worse than one another.
	- Boas first studied physical science at the University of Kiel in Germany. As a trained scientist, he was familiar with using empirical methods as a way to study a subject. Boas worked to transform anthropology into a professional and empirical academic discipline that integrated the four subdisciplines.


### Anthropological Perspectives

- #def **Holism** : The theory that parts of a whole are in intimate interconnection, such that they cannot exist independently of the whole, or cannot be understood without reference to the whole, which is thus regarded as greater than the sum of its parts.
	- Anthropology is a *holistic* discipline.
- Cultural Relativism (vs. Ethnocentrism)
	- Anthropology is all about cultural relativism. We don't judge.
- Comparison
- #def **Ethnography** : The process (and the result) of cultural anthropological research (fieldwork).
	- The ethnographic process involves the research method of participant-observation fieldwork. This type of research is *inductive*.
- Scientific vs. Humanistic Approaches
	- Biological Anthropology and Archaeology uses a deductive, scientific approach to conduct research. They collect and analyze material data to answer questions about human origins and evolution.
	- Cultural Anthropology and Linguistic Anthropology uses a inductive, humanistic approach to conduct research. They collect and analyze non-material data (e.g. observations of everyday life or language).
	- At times, the anthropology community clashes with each other over the definition or mission statement of anthropology - whether to call it "science" or "public understanding". As of now, it is predominantly categorized as a social science.


## Chapter 2 : The Culture Concept

### Learning Objectives

- Compare and contrast the ideas of **ethnocentrism** and **cultural relativism**.
- Describe the role that early anthropologists **Sir James Frazer** and **Sir E. B. Tylor** played in defining the concept of culture in anthropology.
- Identify the differences between **armchair anthropology** and **participant-observer fieldwork** and explain how **Bronislaw Malinowski** contributed to the development of anthropological fieldwork techniques.
- Identify the contributions **Franz Boas** and his students made to the development of new theories about culture.
- Assess some of the **ethical issues** that can arise from anthropological research.


### Stories As a Reflection on Culture

- #def **The Other** : A term that has been used to describe people whose customs, beliefs, or behaviors are "different" from one's own.
	- Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift explores the concept of *the Other*, as Gulliver thinks the Lilliputians are strange and unusual, whereas the Lilliputians thinks Gulliver as strange and unusual.

---
On the topic of Armchair Anthropology

- #def **Armchair Anthropology** : An early and discredited method of anthropological research that did not involve direct contact with the people studied.
	- Early anthropologists solely relied on the written accounts and opinions of others; they presented facts and developed their "stories" based only on those.
	- If a culture is viewed only from a distance, the culture can only be measured and compared by their own vantage point. This gives way to ethnocentric views.
- #person **Sir James Frazer** (1854-1941), a Scottish social anthropologist, is well-known for his 1890 work *The Golden Bough: A Study of Comparative Religions*. Its title was later changed to *A Study in Magic and Religion*, and it was one of the first books to describe and record magical and religious beliefs of different culture groups around the world.
	- This book was not the outcome of extensive study. Frazer relied on the accounts of others who had traveled (e.g. scholars, missionaries, and government officials) to formulate his study. Classic armchair anthropology.
- #person **Sir Edward B. Tylor** (1832-1917), the first professor of anthropology at Oxford University in 1896, was an important influence in the development of sociocultural anthropology as a separate discipline.
	- Tylor defined culture as "that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, law, morals, custom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society". His definition of culture is still used frequently today and remains the foundation to the culture concept in anthropology.
	- Tylor believed that cultures were subject to evolution, just like plants and animals, and thought that cultures developed over time from simple to complex. Many 19th century anthropologists (e.g. Herbert Spencer, Leslie White) believed in *Cultural Evolutionism*.
		- #def **Cultural Evolutionism** : A theory suggesting cultures change and develop through stages, from simple to complex, much like biological evolution, by adapting culturally transmitted information (ideas, tech, behaviors) via social learning (teaching, imitation) in response to problems.
			- This theory is discredited due to the fact that it leads to racist and ethnocentric bias (thinking complex culture is superior, and that all cultures evolve toward a single form of civilization), and the fact that Darwinian analogy does not work at all (cultural change is strategic and not random).
			- Conflicting views about cultural evolutionism in the 19th century highlight an ongoing **nature versus nurture** debate about whether biology shapes behavior more than culture.
- While armchair anthropology sucks, it still made an important impact to the development of anthropology as a discipline in the late 19th century. Their work did ask important questions.

---
On the topic of Participant-Observation

- Bronislaw Malinowski (see previous notes) went "native" to some extent.
	- #def **Going Native** : Becoming fully integrated into a cultural group through acts such as taking a leadership position, assuming key roles in society, entering into marriage, or other behaviors that incorporate an anthropologist into the society he or she is studying.
		- While Participant-Observation is a decent method to gather ethnographic data, going native poses ethical problems; it puts both the anthropologist and the culture group at risk by blurring the lines on both sides of the relationship.


### The Development of Theories of Culture

---
Anthropology in Europe

- The discipline of cultural anthropology developed somewhat differently in Europe and North America.
	- Many Europeans were particularly interested in questions about how societies were structured and how they remained stable over time. This highlighted emerging recognition that culture and society are not the same.
		- Culture had been defined by Tylor as knowledge, beliefs, and customs, but a society is more than just shared ideas or habits. In every society, people are linked to one another through social institutions (e.g. families, political organizations, and businesses).
			- Europeans often focused their research on understanding the form and function of these social institutions.
- European anthropologists developed theories of *functionalism* to explain how social institutions contribute to the organization of society and the maintenance of social order.
	- #def **Functionalism** : Viewing society as a complex system with interdependent parts (e.g. family, education, government) that work together to maintain stability, solidarity, and equilibrium. In other words, each part of the society works as a function for the whole.
		- One function of educational institutions like schools is to provide knowledge that prepares people to obtain jobs and make contributions to society.
		- #person **A.R. Radcliffe-Brown**, a British anthropologist, suggested that in many societies it was the family that served as the most important social structure (function) because family relationships determined much about an individual's social, political, and economic relationships and these patterns were repeated from one generation to the next.
		- One critique of functionalism is that it views cultures as stable and orderly; it ignores or cannot explain social change.
		- Another critique of functionalism is that it cannot explain why a society develops one particular kind of social institution instead of another (sounds vague but whatever).
		- Functionalist theory helped develop the concept of culture by demonstrating that culture is not just set of ideas or beliefs, but consists of specific practices and social institutions that give structure to daily life and allow human communities to function.

Anthropology in the US

- **Cultural relativism** was hot since the 19th century in US.
- Reminder that **Franz Boas** is acknowledged for redirecting American anthropologists away from cultural evolutionism and toward cultural relativism.
	- In 1883, Boas went on a geographical expedition and studied the culture and language of the central Eskimo (Inuit) people on Baffin Island. It was his first major contribution to anthropology, and it convinced him that cultures could only be understood through extensive field research.
- Boas is often considered the originator of American anthropology because he trained the first generation of them, including Ruth Benedict, Margaret Mead, and Alfred Kroeber.
- #person **Ruth Benedict** (one of Boas' first female students) used cultural relativism as a starting point for investigating the cultures of the American northwest and southwest.
	- Her best-selling book *Patterns of Culture* (1934) emphasized that culture gives people coherent patterns for thinking and behaving. She argued that culture affects individuals psychologically, shaping individual personality traits and leading the members of a culture to exhibit similar traits (such as tendency toward aggression or calmness).
	- Benedict was a professor at Columbia University and taught Margaret Mead.
- #person **Margaret Mead**, one of the most well-known female American cultural anthropologists, was a pioneer in conducting ethnographic research at a time when the discipline was predominately male.
	- Her 1925 research on adolescent girls on the island of Tau in the Samoan Islands, published as *Coming of Age in Samoa* (1928), revealed that teenagers in Samoa did not experience the same stress and emotional difficulties as those in the United States.
		- This book was an important contribution to the nature versus nurture debate. It also reinforced the idea that individual emotions and personality traits are products of culture.
- #person **Alfred Louis Kroeber**, another student of Boas, was particularly interested in how cultures change over time and influence one another.
	- In his book *The Nature of Culture* (1952), Kroeber examined the historical processes that led cultures to emerge as distinct configurations, as well as the way cultures could become more similar through the spread or diffusion of cultural traits.
	- Kroeber was also interested in language and its role in transmitting culture. He studied Native American languages.
- Boas and his students emphasized the importance of *enculturation* in their definition of Culture. They established that, through enculturation, culture shapes individual identity, self-awareness, and emotions in fundamental ways.
- Boas and his students also emphasized the need for *holistic* approaches to research that considered the entire context of a society including its history.
- Kroeber and others established the importance of language as an element of culture and documented the ways in which language was used to communicate complex ideas. By the late 20th century, new approaches to symbolic anthropology put language at the center of analysis.
	- #person Clifford Geertz, the founding member of postmodernist anthropology, noted in his book *The Interpretation of Cultures* (1973) that culture should not be seen as something that was "locked inside people's heads". Instead, culture was openly communicated through speech and other behaviors.
		- He concluded that culture is "an historically transmitted pattern of meanings embodied in symbols, a system of inherited conceptions expressed in symbolic forms by means of which men communicate, perpetuate, and develop their knowledge about and their attitudes toward life".

---
Ethical issues in truth telling

- **The Nuremberg trials** (which began in 1945 in Nuremberg, Germany and were conducted under the direction of the France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States) prosecuted members of the Nazi regime for war crimes.
	- In addition to military and political figures, physicians and scientists were also prosecuted for unethical human experimentation and mass murder. The trials demonstrated that physicians and other scientists could be dangerous if they used their skills for abusive or exploitative goals.
	- **The Nuremberg Code** that emerged from the trials is considered a landmark document in medical and research ethics. It established principles for the ethical treatment of the human subjects involved in any medical or scientific research.
		- Many universities adopted principles from the Nuremberg Code to write ethical guidelines for the treatment of human subjects. Anthropologists and students who work in universities where these guidelines exist are obliged to follow these rules.
- The **American Anthropological Association (AAA)**, along with many other organizations in other countries, developed codes of ethics describing specific expectations for anthropologists engaged in research in a variety of settings.
	- The principles in the AAA code of ethics include:
		- do no harm;
		- be open and honest regarding your work;
		- obtain informed consent and necessary permissions;
		- ensure the vulnerable populations in every study are protected from competing ethical obligations;
		- make your results accessible; protect and preserve your records;
		- and maintain respectful and ethical professional relationships.
- Bronislaw Malinowski was exposed after his death because some douche revealed his private diary and published it as *A Diary in the Strictest Sense of the Term* (1967). It turned out Malinowski had sexual fantasies and insensitive/contemptuous opinions about the Trobriand Islanders. While looking at private diaries isn't cool, it provided valuable insight on how professional anthropologists can have bias in their research.
- #person **Napolean Chagnon** (anthropologist) and **James Neel** (geneticist) carried out research in 1960s among an indigenous group living in the Amazon rainforest in Brazil and Venezuela called the **Yanomami**.
	- Neel was interested in studying the effects of radiation released by nuclear explosions on people living in remote areas.
	- Chagnon was investigating theories about the role of violence in Yanomami society.
	- In 2000, an American journalist, Patrick Tierney, published a book about Chagnon and Neel’s research: *Darkness in El Dorado: How Scientists and Journalists Devastated the Amazon*. The book contained numerous stunning allegations, including a claim that the pair had deliberately infected the Yanomami with measles, starting an epidemic that killed thousands of people. The book also claimed that Neel had conducted medical experiments without the consent of the Yanomami and that Chagnon had deliberately created conflicts between Yanomami groups so he could study the resulting violence.
		- The AAA investigated this issue, found them guilty but later rescinded its own conclusion due to citing problems. This whole issue is still debated today because truth can be elusive in anthropological inquiry.
