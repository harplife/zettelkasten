# D3
D3, short for __Data-Driven Documents__, is a [[javascript|JavaScript]] library for visualizing data using web standards.

It's important to note that D3 packs a lot of tools for handling data.
D3 (latest, 7) is modular, meaning you don't have to import the whole library.

I would rate the difficulty of this library 7/10, as it would take at least a week to get some sense of how it works. It's not an easy library to handle, and in fact, I would describe it as the low-level programming language (while Plotly or Chart.js is high-level).
