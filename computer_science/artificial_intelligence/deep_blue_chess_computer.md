# Deep Blue
A Chess Playing machine developed by IBM that won a match against a world class chess player.

## Highlights
- A chess playing computer developed by IBM.
- It was the first computer to win both a chess game and a chess match against a reigning world champion under regular time controls.
- Development for Deep Blue began in 1985 with the ChipTest project at Carnegie Mellon University.
- Grandmaster (Chess World Champion) Joel Benjamin was part of the development team.
- It was briefly named "[ChipTest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChipTest)", later [Deep Thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Thought_(chess_computer))", and then lastly was renamed to Deep Blue in 1989.
- It won its first game against world champion Garry Kasparov on 10 February 1996. However, Kasparov won the match.
- It won its first match against world champion Garry Kasparov on May 1997, becoming the first computer system to defeat a world champion in a match under standard chess tournament time controls.
- When Deep Blue won against Kasparov, Kasparov accused IBM of cheating.

There's a lot more info on this tho. Look up later.

## Thoughts
- Ability to play strategic game against a human opponent is considered one of the ways to measure [[machine_learning|Artificial Intelligence]], similar to [[turing_test|Turing Test]].
