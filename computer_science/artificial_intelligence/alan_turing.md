- Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical [[computer_science|Computer Science]] and [[machine_learning|Artificial Intelligence]].
- Turing graduated from King's College (Cambridge), with a degree in mathematics.
- Turing published a proof demonstrating that some purely mathematical yes/no questions (Decision Problems) can never be answered by computation, and went on to prove the Halting Problem #todo for Turing Machines is undecidable.

There's so much more.. #todo
