# Turing Test
- Turing test is a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behaviour equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human.
- The "standard interpretation" of the Turing Test, in which player C, the interrogator, is given the task of trying to determine which player, A or B, is a computer/human. The interrogator is limited to using the responses to written questions to make the determination.

There's much much more.. #todo
