# Turing Machine
- A Turing Machine is a mathematical model of computation #todo that defines an abstract machine #todo that manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules.
- Despite the model's simplicity, given any computer algorithm, a Turing Machine capable of simulating that algorithm's logic can be constructed.
- It was invented in 1936 by [[alan_turing|Alan Turing]], who called it an "a-machine" (automatic machine).

There's so much more! #todo
