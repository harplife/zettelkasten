# Computing Machinery and Intelligence
- _Computing Machinery and Intelligence_ is a seminal paper written by [[alan_turing|Alan Turing]] on the topic of [[machine_learning|Artificial Intelligence]].
- It was published in 1950 in _[Mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_(journal))_.
- It was the first to introduce his concept of what is now known as the [[turing_test|Turing Test]] to the general public.
- Turing's paper considers the question "Can machines think?"
- Turing says that since the words "think" and "machine" cannot be clearly defined, we should "replace the question by another, which is closely related to it and is express in relatively unambiguous words."
