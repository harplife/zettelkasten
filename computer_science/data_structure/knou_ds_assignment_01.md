# Difference between Conceptualization, Abstraction, and Actualization
This question was a part of 2021 Fall Semester KNOU Data Structure Mid-Term (Attendance) Assignment.

This is my answer, as interpreted from the textbook and other sources.

## Conceptualization
Conceptualization is the process of defining an object (or various objects) with general notion of its features that can be intuitively understood by people.

A _concept_ is the result.

### example
A _concept_ of a "Car" would be "a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation".

A _concept_ of a "Stack (data structure)" would be "a data structure where last item going in is the first to get out (LIFO)".

## Abstraction
Abstraction is the process of defining an object with its core concepts, while also strictly defining its features.

I'm not quite sure what to call the "result" of abstraction. For now, I'll use the term _abstract_.

### example
An _abstract_ of a "Car" would be "An object with a body that is capable of taking in a number of people, wheels that can support the body and generate friction on its surface, an engine that burns fuel to create torque, and etc."

An _abstract_ of a "Stack (data structure)" would be "a data structure with Push() and Pop() capabilities".

## Actualization
Actualization is the process of implementing _abstract_ features into reality.

### example
An _actualization_ of a "Car" would involve "gathering materials, running a factory, making components, and putting them together", as well as, "ride the car".

An _actualization_ of a "Stack (data structure)" would involve "making a Stack" or "using Stack and its functions for computation".

# My Thoughts
I'm not sure why the teacher thought it was necessary to emphasize the difference between Conceptualization, Abstraction, and Actualization.

It seems like just writing about Abstraction would've been enough, as no other courses on Data Structure delve deep into defining what Conceptualization and Actualization means. Also, these feel like common sense.

In fact, I would've liked to know why and how _Abstraction_ in [[computer_science|Computer Science]] is so much different than "Abstraction" we commonly understand.
