# Linear Algebra Online Class
- KNOU 2021 Fall Semester Linear Algebra Online Class via ZOOM
- Taught by Professor Yang (양\*욱) from I\*\*\*\*\*n Campus
- Taught at 11/9

## Contents
1. Textbook Chapter 3
    - Matrix Operation
2. Textbook Chapter 4
    - Inverse Matrix
    - Nonsingular Matrix
3. Textbook Chapter 5
    - Determinant (using Laplace? including cofactors)

## Attendance
"Admin" mentioned camera must be on for the entire duration of class, however, whether that counts toward attendance is highly improbable as the professor did not emphasize on it, not many people actually turned on their camera, and there are quizzes which obviously cannot be done without actually attending class.

So, all in all, taking the quizzes count as taking attendance.

Each quiz (via Google Form) is at the end of each session, within 10 minutes.
3~4 questions per quiz.
Questions include "Get Determinant for _A_ (3x3)".

## My Thought
Going over three chapters over 3 hours is ridiculous.
Had I not studied ahead of time, I wouldn't have understood.
But because I studied ahead of time, I did understand, but then there was no point in attending the class because it's already something I know.
It's pointless when the professor doesn't interact with the class.
The course is already taught by a professor via online video.
It's basically the same thing, except it's a different teacher, and more content in a shorter amount of time.

Basically, the whole class was inefficient. I admit the professor wasn't terrible at explaining things, but he didn't make the best use of his time.

The only upside was that the quizzes would replace the assignment. However, the downside was that the each quiz had to be done within 10 minutes, which was nearly impossible to do when you are rather new to the topic.

I do admit that I could've just used internet to find the answers though. I thought of this only too late, at the third and last quiz.

I hate that I messed up on matrix multiplication question in the 1st quiz. I figured it out right after I turned it in. I felt so rushed.

I'm glad that I had watched MIT Professor Strang's course videos. Those really helped. However, as the class progressed, I realized that those videos didn't really cover _all_ the details - most of the details had to come from the textbook. What Professor Strang really covered was "how things work together". Whereas the textbook, or class, covered "what is, and how they work".

#todo organize Linear Algebra notes in a way that explains things like "This is Matrix Elimination, and in order to do this, you must know the properties of Matrix Operations".
