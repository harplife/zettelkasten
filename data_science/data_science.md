# Data Science
Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from noisy, structured and unstructured data, and apply knowledge and actionable insights from data cross a broad range of application domains.

Data Science is related to data mining, machine learning and big data.

Data Science is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis, informatics, and their related methods" in order to "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data.

Data Science uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, [[computer_science|Computer Science]], information science, and domain knowledge. However, Data Science is different from computer science and information science.
