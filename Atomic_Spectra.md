# Atomic Spectra

Every element has a unique set of frequencies it can emit or absorb.

When atoms are energized, their electrons jump between allowed energy levels. Each jump emits or absorbs light of a specific frequency - this produces **Spectral Lines**.
- These frequencies are discrete, characteristic, and unique to each element.

Example :
- Hydrogen emits specific red, blue, violet lines
- Sodium produces a strong yellow doublet
- Neon produces red-orange light
