# GUI programming with Dear ImGui
## Dear ImGui
- Github - https://github.com/ocornut/imgui
- Dear ImGui is a bloat-free GUI library for C++, which was designed to enable fast iterations and to empower programmers to create content creation tools and visualization / debug tools (as opposed to UI for the average end-user).
	- It favors simplicity and productivity toward this goal and lacks certain features commonly found in more high-level libraries (such as full internationalization and accessibility features).
