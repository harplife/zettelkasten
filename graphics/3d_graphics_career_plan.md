This note will serve as the main note to plan everything related to launching myself into the 3D Graphics Industry. That means, I'll look at exactly what I'm trying to achieve, and how to achieve that. However, knowing that things can change over time, I'll need to re-iterate my plan.

#### Key Points
- TA Responsibility 1 : Build a tool to help artists. It's important to understand the artist's request, but also to see if the request is reasonable (or not).
- TA Responsibility 1 Example 1 : Build a tool that populates a village with randomized villagers using a number of presets (so that the artist doesn't have to make each villager individually).
- TA Responsibility 1 Example 2 : Build a tool to count the number of birds appearing in the sky at any given time.
- TA Responsibility 2 : Troubleshoot problems as they come up. Problems may include fixing a tool that doesn't work right, dealing with memory limitations, or dealing with assets that don't look right.
- TA Responsibility 3 : Manage the Game Development Pipeline. It may include creating programs that help sort data, or programs that deal with version control.
- TA may specialize in Shaders.
- TA may specialize in Rigging, or making tools for Rigging (to speed up the process).
- Other TA Responsibilities : creating game exporters, making backgrounds, creating textures, or developing lighting systems.
- TA have to have the know-how to do a bit of everything.
- Average salary of TA is $71,000 a year. More specializations, higher the price. Larger companies pay $100,000 a year.
- Experience and Portfolio is the most important thing to get into TA career.

### 3D Artist to Software Engineer
Article : [3D Artist to Software Engineer by Daniel Eagle (blog post)](https://www.danieleagle.com/2014/07/3d-artist-to-software-engineer/)

This article was mentioned in [The Reality of Being a Programmer and an Artist | r/gamedev](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/2hucbk/the_reality_of_being_a_programmer_and_an_artist/) (which was also routed from a reddit post asking how to become a TA). Although it is an old article from 2014, the content of the article seems relevant still. However, this article is geared more towards giving advice to artists on how to become a Software Engineer, not the other way around.

#### Key Points
- This is an article by Daniel Eagle. It looks like he's working as a Cloud Engineering Manager at Oracle, according to his [Linkedin Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danieleagle/). It doesn't seem like he's worked as a TA at all.
- Daniel studied Computer Animation (3D Art) at The International Academy of Design and Technology.
- Daniel learned Maya.
- Daniel studied Computer Animation for 2 years but dropped out. 5 years later, he studied at University of Phoenix to major Information Technology.
- Daniel learned JS, .NET, C#, C++, and etc.
- At the time of the writing (2014), Daniel was working at HP as Web Developer (using ASP.NET with MVC).
- Daniel thinks Technical Artist is 30% Software Engineer and 70% 3D Artist (but up for debate).
- Daniel thinks it's better to focus on either SW or 3D Art but not both.
- Daniel does give tips on how to continue 3D Art on the side.
- Some books were recommended (listed below in the Wishlist under Resources of this note).

#### Thoughts
- Daniel started out as an artist but became a fully dedicated programmer at a major company. I think this can serve as an example of a person who succeeded turning their life around while risking his effort and time for the better future.
- I think it's still important to get a degree in Computer Science. I'm not too keen on majoring in Arts, even if I'm going into the industry closely tied with Arts.
- Daniel does bring a good point on focusing on one thing (as opposed to multiples). While I agree with his point, I think that I need a stronger resolve to take on multiple things. Fact of the matter is, I love learning; The kind of career that requires me to learn various things is the perfect career for me.
