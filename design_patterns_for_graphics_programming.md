# Design patterns for graphics programming
In GPU-driven computer graphics, design patterns that focus on **performance**, **efficient memory use**, and **parallel processing** are particularly useful. Here are some patterns that tend to perform well in these contexts:

## 1. **Flyweight Pattern**
   - **Purpose**: Minimizes memory usage by sharing as much data as possible between similar objects.
   - **Use Case**: In graphics programs, there may be many identical or similar elements (e.g., particles, models with shared textures). The Flyweight pattern enables these objects to share common data, reducing memory overhead.
   - **Example**: Particle systems often use Flyweight to share properties like color and texture data across many particles while storing unique data like position separately.

## 2. **Object Pool Pattern**
   - **Purpose**: Manages a set of reusable objects to avoid costly allocations and deallocations.
   - **Use Case**: Graphics applications with many short-lived objects, such as particles or light sources, benefit from object pools. Rather than constantly creating and destroying objects, an object pool keeps a ready supply of pre-allocated objects, which can be reused and returned to the pool.
   - **Example**: For a particle effect, a pool of particle objects can be preallocated, then used and reset as needed for new effects.

## 3. **Data-Oriented Design (ECS - Entity Component System)**
   - **Purpose**: Emphasizes efficient data layout and access patterns, ideal for GPU workloads and parallel processing.
   - **Use Case**: ECS separates entities (which are often just IDs) from their data (components) and behavior (systems), allowing efficient access patterns for GPU processing. This is often implemented with arrays of component data that can be processed in parallel, ideal for large-scale simulations.
   - **Example**: In a game engine, an ECS system would allow each entity (such as a character or an object) to have components like `Position`, `Velocity`, and `RenderData`. Systems then operate on these components in bulk, minimizing cache misses and maximizing parallelism.

## 4. **Command Pattern**
   - **Purpose**: Encapsulates commands as objects to defer execution or batch commands together.
   - **Use Case**: In GPU graphics, commands such as drawing calls, shader operations, or state changes can be batched or deferred until ready for GPU execution, reducing CPU-GPU sync overhead.
   - **Example**: Rendering engines use command buffers to store drawing commands, which are later sent in bulk to the GPU, rather than issuing each command immediately.

## 5. **Prototype Pattern**
   - **Purpose**: Enables efficient copying of complex objects.
   - **Use Case**: Useful when a graphics application needs to create multiple instances of objects that are similar but not identical (e.g., characters with minor variations).
   - **Example**: In a scene with many similar characters, the engine can use one prototype character and create customized copies for each instance without reloading all data.

## 6. **Visitor Pattern**
   - **Purpose**: Allows adding new operations to objects without modifying their structures, useful for operations that may change frequently.
   - **Use Case**: In a graphics pipeline, the Visitor pattern can be used for operations that traverse scene graphs or perform multiple operations (e.g., visibility checks, transformations).
   - **Example**: A rendering engine may use a Visitor to traverse a scene graph and apply a series of transformations to each node.

## Summary
In GPU-driven computer graphics, **Data-Oriented Design (ECS)** and **Command Pattern** are highly impactful for leveraging GPU parallelism and reducing CPU-GPU overhead. The **Flyweight**, **Object Pool**, and **Prototype** patterns also play critical roles in memory management and efficiency, especially in real-time applications like games and simulations.
