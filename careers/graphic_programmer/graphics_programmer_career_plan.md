# Graphics Programmer Career Plan
For details about the career, check out [[graphics_programmer|What is Graphics Programmer]].

## Qualifications
- [ ] Bachelor (or Master) in [[computer_science|Computer Science]], or Computer Graphics related fields
    - [ ] [[goal_bachelor_in_cs|Get a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science]]
    - [ ] Get a Master's Degree in Computer Science
- [ ] Advanced skills in C/[[cpp|C++]] (depends)
- [ ] Advanced skills in Scripting Languages ([[python|Python]], MEL, or etc)
- [ ] Familiar with Parallel Processing (and Multi-Threading)
- [ ] Experience with Animation tools (Maya, Nuke, Vray, etc)
- [ ] Familiar with Animation Pipeline
- [ ] Good with math (especially Linear Algebra)
- [ ] Familiar with Ray Tracing
- [ ] (Optional) familiar with [[machine_learning|Machine Learning]]

## First Step
I'm already familiar with Python.
I learned C++ recently (while studying CS), but I don't have much experience with it.
Since I don't know anything about _Game Engine_, I will follow this youtube [playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT) on building a game engine from scarch with C++. #todo
I'm thinking this will help me learn UI Programming.

Reading books on Math in Game Engine would help too.

- [ ] 수학으로 시작하는 3D 게임 개발 (교보문고 hardcover)

## Second Step
Practice more C++ and learn about Ray Tracing.
Following this [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) should be informative. #todo
Also, there are videos by Cherno optimising someone's code relating to this, so watch that as well ([video 1](https://youtu.be/mOSirVeP5lo), [video 2](https://youtu.be/sb1FtMYAcYQ)).

Reading books on Shaders would help too.

## Third Step
Learn animation. Learn Maya. #todo
There are so many things to learn, so I might have to learn Maya little bits at a time.
Otherwise, I might have to go to Hakwon for it.

## Fourth Step
Maybe learn other tools, or build plugins. #todo

## Fifth Step
I need to learn about parallel processing. How? I don't know yet. #todo
