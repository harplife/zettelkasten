# Gyedo Jeon
I ran into Gyedo's [reply to someone's question on Gamecodi](https://gamecodi.com/793/%EA%B7%B8%EB%9E%98%ED%94%BD%EC%8A%A4-%EC%A7%81%EC%97%85%EC%9D%80-%EA%B2%8C%EC%9E%84-%EC%A7%81%EC%97%85%EA%B5%B0-%EC%99%B8%EC%97%90-%EC%96%B4%EB%96%A4-%EB%B6%84%EC%95%BC%EA%B0%80-%EC%9E%88%EB%82%98%EC%9A%94) while I was looking into Computer Graphics career. In Gyedo's replies, he mentioned that he works in an animation department and he wrote all about it on his [blog](https://post.naver.com/my.naver?memberNo=1955589).

I went to his blog, and this was the first time I've ever heard of a job position called [[technical_director|Technical Director]].

In fact, the main reason why I'm writing a note about Gyedo is because I want to reference his stories to plan my career to become a TD.

## Education
Gyedo earned Bachelor of Engineering (Computer Science) from Yonsei University (top notch school in S.Korea). He studied from 1993 to 1997. This is according to his [Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gyedo/).

## Early Occupations in S.Korea (1998-2003)
(As of 2021/12/26) Gyedo hasn't really written much about his early occupations on his blog. According to his Linkedin profile, he was working as a Lead CG Programmer from 1998 to 2002. His work involved:
1. Writing MEL Scripts and Maya Plugins for production
2. Designing & implementing production DB
3. Making Particle FX for TV Commercials

In 2002 to 2003, he was a __Senior Researcher (Programmer)__ at EPG.
His work involved:
1. Writing scene analysis/modification module of the company's proprietary online rendering management software
2. Working on building business pipeline for online rendering services

From this point on, his life really turned around.

## Early Occupations in USA (2003-2007)
Gyedo's series ["Why do you live in USA?"](https://m.post.naver.com/my/series/detail.naver?seriesNo=451629&memberNo=1955589&prevVolumeNo=14647395) begins from this point.

Gyedo's company at the time had a branch in USA (now [RenderCore](https://www.rendercore.com/en/home)).
He was told to go on a business trip to the USA branch, which was meant to be temporary. Gyedo ended up working there for more than 6 months, and eventually he switched his employment to the USA branch.

His job was __Senior Programmer & Customer Relations Coordinator__.
His work involved:
1. Working on RenMan2 (the company's proprietary online rendering management software)
2. Writing plugins for Maya, LightWave, and 3dsMax to communicate with the RenMan2
3. Designing & implementing cluster daemon program in C++
4. Working on setting up rendering business pipeline (in USA)
5. Developing a web-based cluster management and business application, using JSP and MS SQL

In 2004, EPG started having a tough time. So he quit his job and started working for SemoLogic as a __CG Programmer__.
His work involved:
1. Designing & implementing a project / asset management system using J2EE and MySQL
2. Researching on anatomy-based facial animation system
3. Implementing volume-preserving FFD using augmented Lagrangian methods
4. Building tools for artists to create high end 3D game cinematics
    - cinematics for Red Ninja (Vivendi Universal), God of War (SCEA), God of War 2 (SCEA), Shaiya (SonoV) and Aion (NCSoft)
5. Writing plugins for Maya using MEL and Maya API

Starting in 2005, SemoLogic started having a tough time. In 2007, Gyedo decides to quit and applied to a number of big animation companies (Disney, Blizzard, DreamWorks, [Rhythm & Hues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm_and_Hues_Studios), [Midway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midway_Games), [Heavy Iron](https://heavyiron.games/)).

Disney VR hired Gyedo.

## 9 Years at Disney (2007-2016)
Gyedo's series ["9 Years at Disney"](https://post.naver.com/my/series/detail.naver?memberNo=1955589&seriesNo=456136&prevVolumeNo=14950960) begins from this point.
Gyedo moved around a lot in between departments throughout the years.
There are a lot more details about his job(s) in the series.

Below is the job description according to his Linkedin profile.

__Senior Software Engineer__ (2007-2014)
1. Writing and maintaing MMO game codes
2. Porting games from Action Script to C++
3. Designing & implementing various in-house tools including level editors, quest editor, data conversion tools from Maya to proprietary game engines
4. Working on real-time 3D graphics engine ([Panda3D](https://www.panda3d.org/))

__Senior Game Programmer__ (2014-2016)
1. Building content creation tools for Disney's Smart Toy Game System
2. Building device simulator for efficient development
3. Building audio editor to create audio based game play missions
4. Building automated production pipeline / test tools

I think it's important to note that Disney tried really hard to succeed in the game industry. Gyedo's stories describes Disney's many attempts, from building their own engines and games to acquiring game companies that struck gold. In the end, Disney ends up outsourcing most of their game projects.

That's when there was a big layoff, and Gyedo was caught in it.

## Working at DreamWorks (2016 - now)
Gyedo's series ["Technical Director's Journal"](https://post.naver.com/my/series/detail.nhn?seriesNo=456144&memberNo=1955589) begins from this point.

There isn't much about his job description on his Linkedin profile.
As a [[technical_director|Technical Director]], he worked on these projects:
1. DreamPlace: Adventure to Santa
2. Captain Underpands: The First Epic Movie (2017)
3. Bilby (2018)
4. How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World (2019)
5. Abominable (2019)
6. The Croods: A New Age (2020)
7. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022)

The films in the list above are the ones that mention Gyedo in the credits.

His blog series has more detail.
I tried ordering them by year, but it's not exact.

### 2016
Working on DreamPlace: Adventure to Santa :
> 이 중에 제가 담당한 부분은 산타 하우스 외벽의 LED 스크린 제어 프로그램이었습니다. 마치 옛날 싸이월드 미니홈피 스킨 바꾸듯이 (앗, 이러면 너무 연식이 드러나나요?) 흠흠 네이버 블로그나 티스토리 등에서 스킨 바꾸듯이 이 외벽의 기본 스킨도 변경이 되구요. 각각의 변경된 스킨 테마에 따라 짧은 애니메이션 개그가 각 zone에서 플레이가 돼요. 슈렉이 문 열고 나온다던가 동키가 창문에서 인사한다던가 등이요. 그런데, 만약 슈렉이 문 여는 애니메이션이 한 쪽에 플레이되고 있는데, 다른 쪽 창문에서 쉬렉이 또 손을 흔들면 안되잖아요? 그런 것들도 다 제가 담당한 프로그램이 컨트롤 했습니다.

The main thing to note is that Gyedo worked on a program that controls LED Screens. One of the functionalities involved managing character appearances on multiple screens (making sure a character is displayed only on a single screen).

While working on DreamPlace, Gyedo also built tools for Artists using After Effects, tools that connect After Effects to a Render Farm. The issue was that DreamWorks Render Farm only runs on Linux while After Effects only works on Windows and Mac. Basically, After Effects couldn't render using the render farm.

Gyedo worked on that issue by customizing and installing [Rush](http://seriss.com/rush/) on the Render Farm. Then, he built After Effects plugins that work with Rush.

> 그런데 저는 이전까지는 After Effects를 만져본 적도 없어요 ^^ TD의 직업 특징 중 하나가 새로운 소프트웨어나 기술을 빨리 습득해야 한다는 점입니다.

One thing to note is that Gyedo has never worked with After Effects before, so he had to learn it really quick. He mentions that it wasn't too difficult to build the plugins because After Effects provides [[javascript|JavaScript]] API, and Adobe provides ExtendScript Toolkit that helps with building plugins.

The plugins that Gyedo made was used in the makings of The Croods (2013), Trolls (2016), Captain Underpants (2017), and possibly other movies.

For some reason, Gyedo didn't include that in his Linkedin profile.

### 2017
Skipping a little note about Animation Pipeline #todo 

DreamWorks used to work with [Pacific Data Images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Data_Images) pipeline that was made back in the 90s, and so they sought to make a new pipeline. Gyedo worked in that project, building plugins that can connect DreamWorks' proprietary lighting tool to the new generation pipeline.

I'm having a hard time understanding whether this "pipeline" is a conceptual process of animation, or an actual program that connects and manages all departments of animation. In Gyedo's blog, he says the new generation pipeline was made with Micro-service Architecture (and also with Spring Framework).

In late 2017, Gyedo participated in Bilby project - building tools and plugins for [RV](https://www.shotgridsoftware.com/rv/), and [Nuke](https://www.foundry.com/products/nuke-family/nuke).

Also, Gyedo worked on implementing Pixar's [Universal Scene Description](https://graphics.pixar.com/usd/release/index.html) to the new gen pipeline (ongoing).

### 2018
After Bilby, Gyedo came back to work on the new gen pipeline. He worked on connecting [Premo](https://www.awn.com/animationworld/dreamworks-premo-animation-system-garners-sci-tech-honors) and [Katana](https://www.foundry.com/products/katana) to the pipeline (ongoing).

The new gen pipeline was used in making How to Train Your Dragon : The Hidden World (2019) and Abominable (2019). Note that HTTYD 3 was the first one that was made with [MoonRay](https://www.awn.com/animationworld/how-moonray-became-hidden-superpower-behind-how-train-your-dragon-hidden-world), a renderer that uses Path Tracing algorithm.

### 2019 - 2020
Gyedo worked on USD + Pipeline, improving workflow, RV/Shotgun related development, and etc.. He also worked on other node based tools (which he cannot mention).

His tools helped making The Croods : A New Age (2020).

Gyedo's started working remotely since August 2020.

### 2021
I'm guessing he's working on Puss in Boots : The Last Wish (2022).
This [post](https://post.naver.com/viewer/postView.naver?volumeNo=30524417&memberNo=1955589) is the last of the TD series, which was written on 2021/01/20.
He is making other series, like ["For those new to TD"](https://post.naver.com/my/series/detail.naver?seriesNo=643456&memberNo=1955589).
