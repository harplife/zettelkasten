# What is Technical Director (Animation)
Technical Director (TD) is a job position whose responsibilities revolve around helping Animation Artists.

As the name suggests, TD's main task is to deal with _technical_ part of the animation, which range from programming plugins (for animation software) to building a whole program that manages an animation pipeline.

Not only does the TD needs to have a good understanding of the whole process (of animation), TD also needs to have a good understanding of the tools involved (more on this at another section).

Problem solving skills are most appreciated with this job position, as TD's are constantly asked to fix a problem or build something that can automate a repetitive or a complex task.

The way I see it, TD is the RPA (Robotic Process Automation) of the Animation industry.

## Motivation
Technical side of the entertainment industry is really what I've been wanting be at.
I want to be able to support the main players of the industry.
I want to help them bring out their best.
I want to push them further than ever before with advanced technology.

I see myself in the future as a TD, watching an animation our team and I created together, and being amazed by every moment of it. With each scene, I would be proud of myself and the team. Most of all, I would be inspired to do even better.
An emotional feedback loop. That's what I envision.

## Career Plan
Technical Director position is somewhat confusing to me in the sense that I cannot imagine what skills an entry level TD would require, if there is such a thing as an entry level in that position. It seems to require in-depth understanding of each and every tools and processes involved in animation.

I'm trying to see the answers on this [question](https://cglink.com/index.php?mid=talk&l=en&m=0&listStyle=list&page=2&document_srl=2433818) but I need to register (and validation email doesn't work well, apparently).

[[careers/technical_director/gyedo_jeon|Gyedo-nim]] has been very informative so far, since he shares a lot of information about being a TD, not to mention his life stories prior to becoming a TD.

I think it's important to note that he started out as a _CG Programmer_.

Web search doesn't really bring anything up on "CG Programmer", but I think it's more commonly referred to as _Graphics Developer_ or _Graphics Programmer_.
I need to write a note on what Graphics Programmer is. #todo
