# Shubha Jaganatha
I ran into one of her Medium articles  by some luck.

She hasn't written much articles just yet (as of 2022-04-26), but so far all her articles are very well written, not to mention valuable.

She's the 2nd Technical Director I came to know about, with 1st being [[careers/technical_director/gyedo_jeon|Gyedo-nim]].

By the time she's written her article, she's worked at Pixar for 10 months. With her internships at other places, she's worked in the technical animation field for about a couple years.
