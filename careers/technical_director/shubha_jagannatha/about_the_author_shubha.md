# About the Author

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Shubha Jagannatha, a 22 year old engineer working as a Technical Director at Pixar Animation Studios. I recently graduated from UC Berkeley where I received both a bachelor's and master's in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences with a focus on Computer Graphics. I love learning about tech, especially the intersection of tech and the arts, and exploring everything that life has to offer.
