# Get a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science
This is a goal that I started thinking of, once I hit the 1 year mark working as a programmer/data scientist. Back in 2020 December, I attempted to apply to KNOU for the 2021 spring semester, but failed to do so because transcripts from Webster did not arrive on time for registration, due to covid 19 #todo .

I was able to register for the 2021 fall semester though, and began studying at September.

## Objective
There is one combined objective.

Major in [[computer_science|Computer Science]], and minor in [[data_science|Data Science]].

## Deadline
My aim is to acheive this goal in two years - four semesters.
If things work according to plan, it should be done by the end of Spring 2023.

## Motivation
- I want to do more meaningful, complex work.
- I want to be recognized for my skillset.
- I like studying computer science / data science.
- I want to be paid more.
- I want to get a Master's degree in Computer Science.

## Plan
- [x] Register for an undergraduate program in Computer Science
- [ ] Complete 1st semester with GPA higher than 3.5
- [ ] Get a [[certification|Certification]]
- [ ] Register to minor in Data Science
- [ ] Complete 2nd semester with 21 credit hours
- [ ] Complete rest of the semesters

## Concerns
The timing is awful. I may be moving to USA after 2nd semester.
Finals have to be taken at the desginated campus.
Meaning, I may have to go back to S.Korea after each semester.
I'm hoping that I'd at least be able to finish 3rd semester by the time I have to leave for USA.
