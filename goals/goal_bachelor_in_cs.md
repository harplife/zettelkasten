# Get a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science
This is a goal that I started thinking of, once I hit the 1 year mark working as a programmer/data scientist. Back in 2020 December, I attempted to apply to KNOU for the 2021 spring semester, but failed to do so because transcripts from Webster did not arrive on time for registration, due to covid 19.

I was able to register for the 2021 fall semester though, and began studying at September.

## Objective
There is one ~~combined~~ objective.

Major in [[computer_science|Computer Science]], ~~and minor in [[data_science|Data Science]].~~

As of <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">2023-01-01</mark>, I've determined that minoring in Data Science is no longer an option for me. I've messed up quite badly during 2022, pretty much ruining [[컴퓨터과학과_계획_22s1|the 1st semester]], and [[컴퓨터과학과_계획_22s2|the 2nd semester]] of 2022 by completing only one or two classes with grades barely above B. I want to make sure that I graduate from this program this year, double major requires more classes, and I simply cannot do more for each semester.

However, despite the fact that I'm abandoning Data Science minor, I'm still taking some of the core statistics classes.

## Deadline
Graduate after [[컴퓨터과학과_계획_23s2|the 2nd semester of 2023]].

## Motivation
- I want to just be able to say I've majored in Computer Science. I now understand just how much the society seeks credentials. It is a convenient method for people to evaluate professionals.
- I want to work my way up through a Master's Degree, and eventually a Doctorate.
- In general, I want to learn. I want to hone my craft.
- I want to be paid more.
- This is a stepping stone to reach my goal to become a [[technical_director|Technical Director]].
