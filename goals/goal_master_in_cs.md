# Get a Master's Degree in Computer Science
After [[goal_bachelor_in_cs|Get a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science]] plan is done and over with, I'd like to start Master's right away. If I can do it online, I guess that's fine but I feel that the quality of education drops drastically when it's online. If I were to do it offline, however, I'd somehow manage my time with work, or not work at all and go full time student.

## Focus
I'm interested in Computer Vision #todo or Computer Graphics.
I'd like to go even further with [[machine_learning|Machine Learning]] in the mix.
So, all in all, Computer Science with focus on AI in Computer Vision is what I'm going for.

## Traget Schools
### Southern Illinois University Edwardsville
[SIUE CS Department Page](https://www.siue.edu/engineering/computer-science/)

The school is located [here](https://goo.gl/maps/yQ4MVmZG2jqvT7Kk6). It is about 40 minutes from where I possibly might live at.

Tuition is about ~$8,000 for U.S.Resident taking 18 credit hours of Graduate program. More details [here](https://www.siue.edu/paying-for-college/tuition-and-fees/graduate/index.shtml).

According to this [article](https://www.siue.edu/news/2020/03/College-Factual-Ranks-SIUE-Computer-Science-4th-Nationally-for-Best-Value.shtml), _College Factual_ ranks SIUE Computer Science __4th__ nationally for __Best Value__.

Acceptance rate for SIUE is ~85%.

[College Factual](https://www.collegefactual.com/majors/computer-information-sciences/computer-science/rankings/best-graduate-schools/masters-degrees/great-lakes/illinois/) rated SIUE __10th__ on Best Computer Science Graduate program in Illinois.
[4icu](https://www.4icu.org/reviews/5457.htm) says SIUE is __711st__ on world ranking (probably QS).

Check out [SIUE CS Admission Requirements](https://www.siue.edu/academics/graduate/degrees-and-programs/computer-science/admission-requirements.shtml). I might have to study [GRE](https://www.ets.org/gre), and also TOEFL.

SIUE seems to be the optimal choice considering price and location. And honestly, the education doesn't seem too bad.

### Purdue University
[PU Computer Science Department Page](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/)
[PU Computer Graphics Department Page](https://polytechnic.purdue.edu/departments/computer-graphics-technology)

I've seen this university mentioned from time to time, when searching for Computer Science and Computer Graphics online. I think they might be more known for their aviation program, but I could be wrong.

The school is located [here](https://goo.gl/maps/hraqEFeFGBkXRu148). If I were to study here, I'd need to live on campus or something.
In fact, since the tution differs by a lot depending on residency, I might have to live here even before applying.

Tuition is about ~$15,000 for 1 academic year of a CS graduate program. More details [here](https://www.purdue.edu/bursar/tuition/feerates/2020-2021/graduate/computer-science.php).
It doesn't say anything about residence, but it does say it is an estimate for 8+ credit hours. It'd be best to call them and find out for sure.

Acceptance rate for PU (average) is [67%](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/purdue-university-west-lafayette-1825). But for CS, it is [40~50%](https://www.purdueexponent.org/campus/article_14851194-dd66-11e9-8ea0-1764f0ba0b05.html).
Purdue's Computer Science program is gaining popularity, it seems.

PU's QS World Ranking (2021) is __109th__, according to [topuniversities](https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2021).

Check out [Purdue CS Graduate Program Admission Requirements](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/graduate/admission/requirements.html).. I'm a little scared on the Letter of Recommendation part. I also don't know if I need to get TOEFL, if I'm a temporary green card holder.

And then there's [CG Graduate Program Admission Requirements](https://www.purdue.edu/gradschool/prospective/gradrequirements/westlafayette/cgtc.html)... This is totally different than the CS requirements. This one requires [GRE](https://www.ets.org/gre), samples(??), and resume. I don't understand why, but there is [another page](https://polytechnic.purdue.edu/degrees/ms-computer-graphics-technology/admissions) with much more detail.

If I can afford it, I would go here. Purdue really seems like a place I could get in, if I worked on it hard enough.

### Georgia Institute of Technology (OMSCS)
[Georgia Tech CS Department Page](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/)
[Georgia Tech CS Master Online Course Page](https://omscs.gatech.edu/)

Georgia Tech offers an _OMSCS (Online Master of Science in Computer Science)_, a completely online graduate program offered world-wide. It's legit, as in fully recognized and accredited, and the diploma doens't mention anything about "Online". Not only that, it is the most affordable out of all MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) on CS, estimated price at $7k~8k for the whole program (30 credit hours).

The school is located [here](https://goo.gl/maps/tUvX57TRNA9LEEXQ7), but that doesn't matter with OMSCS.

The acceptance rate for Georgia Tech's CS Grad School is __10%__, but apparently ___74%___ for OMSCS (according to this [article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeltnietzel/2021/07/01/georgia-techs-online-ms-in-computer-science-continues-to-thrive-what-that-could-mean-for-the-future-of-moocs/?sh=289dca1ba277)). As long as basic requirements are met, it seems OMSCS accepts anybody.

Georgia Tech ranks __8th__ on CS Grad schools, according to [U.S. News & World Report](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-science-schools/computer-science-rankings?name=Georgia).
Georgia Tech ranks __80th__ on QS World Ranking, according to [topuniversities.com](https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2021).

OMSCS Admission Requirements/Recommendation is on this ["Preparing Yourself"](https://omscs.gatech.edu/preparing-yourself-omscs) and this ["Requirements"](https://omscs.gatech.edu/program-info/application-deadlines-process-requirements).
Simply put:
1. GPA over 3.0 (85%, B)
2. CS Bachelor or equivalent (a few fundamental courses are enough)
3. TOEFL
4. Letters of Recommendation
5. Resume
6. Certfications
7. Statement of Purpose

As far as certifications go, Georgia Tech also offers some fundamental courses online. It is mentioned on the _Preparing Yourself_ page.

Overall, I am all for this. It's almost too good to be true. The location (online), the price, the school ranking, and the quality of education, they are all so great.

### Carnegie Mellon University
[CMU CS Department Page](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/)

The best school all around, best in Computer Science, best in Computer Graphics.
Their [Computer Graphics Lab page] makes me awed.

The school is located [here](https://goo.gl/maps/WwhbNfG4TbLZCD17A). If I were to study here, I'd need to live on campus or something.

Tuition is about ~$80,000 for 1 academic year of a graduate program. More details [here](https://www.cmu.edu/sfs/tuition/graduate/scs.html).
It doesn't say anything about credit hours or residence, so it might actually be much more expensive.

Acceptance rate for CMU (average) is 18%. But for CS, it is 5~7%. More details [here](https://www.collegetransitions.com/blog/how-to-get-into-carnegie-mellon/). 
Even CMU admits how low the acceptance rate is, and has wrote an [article](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/link/meeting-demand) about it.

CMU's QS World Ranking (2021) is __51st__, according to [topuniversities.com](https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2021).

Check out [CMU CS Graduate Program Admission Requirements](https://csd.cmu.edu/academics/masters/admissions). GRE is highly recommended. Three letters of recommendation is the scary part.

All of this information is saying getting into CMU is pretty much a pipe dream.
But, it doesn't hurt to plan and study like this is where I'm going to go.

## Plan
- [ ] GRE

If I go the OMSCS route, I don't have to worry about this.
But other than that, for other schools I do have to care.
SIUE says they accept work experience (relating to CS) in place of GRE, but they require proof and letter of recommendation from employer (nuh uh).
Other schools doesn't seem to offer any GRE replacement.

- [ ] Letters of Recommendation

I might be able to get some from KNOU. I'll have to look into it to be sure.

- [ ] TOEFL

Thie one is a kicker. I can't get it too quick, otherwise I'd be just wasting money.
I'm not too concerned about it though.. but I do wonder if I should study for it.

- [ ] Certifications

Maybe not so much for other schools, but certifications might help for applying OMSCS.
I need to look at OMSCS "Praparation" page for courses that are offered (and accepted).

### Ranking for Computer Graphics
I get rather confusing/conflicting information on this one, but one thing in common seems to be that Carnegie Mellon University wins anywhere.
