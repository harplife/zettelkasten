What happens when light falls onto an object? The answer to this question depends a great deal on the model that we want to use to describe the interaction of light with matter. At the macroscopic level, we may say that light is reflected or absorbed. For example, when sun light falls on our hand part of it gets scattered, as diffuse reflection. (This allows us to see our hand, because this reflected light reaches our eye and forms the image of our hand in our retina.) While some of the sun light is absorbed by our hand. We also sense this portion of the light; it heats our skin. What aspect of the light causes it to be reflected and which aspect of it makes it heat up our skin?

As we discussed earlier, light is electromagnetic wave. The wavelength (or its frequency), and its amplitude are the two primary physical factors that describe its properties. The more intense the light, the higher is the amplitude of the electromagnetic wave. In the particle (photon) picture, this amounts to the number of photons that are "in the light" per unit of time. As in the case of bullets fired by an automatic machine gun, the more bullets fired per second, the "stronger" the amplitude. Continuing with this analogy we notice that the full strength of the gun depends both on the number of bullets it fires as well as on the "strength" of each bullet. It is the wavelength (or frequency) of the light that determines the "strength" of a single bullet. To be more precise, the energy of a single photon, as we discussed earlier, is directly proportional to its frequency (and thus inversely proportional to its wavelength). So, the overall strength of the light is a function of both the number of photons it is delivering per second and the frequency of each photon.

The above discussed dependence of light energy on photon energy as well as on photon rate was not an obvious fact. In fact, it was described by Planck and Einstein at the turn of the twentieth century and won Einstein his Nobel Prize. The discovery of this interdependence of the photon rate and per photon energy not only affected the way we think of light's total energy, but it also has modified our understanding of how light interacts with matter. To examine this interaction further, it is useful to think of matter as composed of atoms and to ask the question how does light (photons) interact with an atom?

빛이 물체에 닿으면 무슨 현상이 일어날까? 이 질문에 대한 답변은 빛과 물질의 상호작용을 어떤 규모로 관측하는지에 달려있다.

거시 규모 (Macroscopic Scale)로서 바라볼때, 우리는 빛이 반사되거나 흡수된다고 말할 수 있다. 예를 들어, 태양광이 우리 손 위에 닿으면, 빛의 일부는 산란 (Scatter)하여 난반사가 된다 (반사된 빛으로서 우리는 손을 볼 수 있다). 동시에, 태양광의 일부는 우리의 손을 통해 흡수가 된다. 우리는 이 흡수된 빛을 열로서 느낀다. 그러면, 정확히 어떤 측면에 있어 빛은 반사되고 또는 흡수되는 것일까?

반사와 흡수의 원리를 이해하기 위해서는, 빛을 입자 (광자)로서 보는 미시 규모로 봐야한다.

이전에 정리했듯이, 빛은 전자기파이다. 빛의 파장 (또는 주파수), 그리고 진폭 (Amplitude)은 빛의 물리적 속성을 설명하는 두 가지 요소가 된다. 빛이 강렬할수록, 진폭이 높다. 빛을 입자 (광자)로 봤을 때, 진폭은 특정 시간 내에 존재하는 광자의 개수로 볼 수 있다. 빛을 기관총으로 비유하면, 총의 "힘(Strength)"이 매 초 나가는 총알 개수고, 빛의 힘은 특정 시간 내에 나가는 광자의 개수인 것이다. 이 비유를 좀 더 확장해보면, 기관총의 전반적 힘은 매 초 나가는 총알 개수 뿐만이 아니라, 나아가는 총알의 힘에도 달려있다 - 총알의 힘은 앞으로 나아가는 운동량이라면, 광자의 힘은 파장 (또는 주파수)의 크기이다. 좀 더 정확히는, 광자의 에너지는 주파수와 정비례 (Directly Proportional)하며, 파장과 반비례 (Inversely Proportional)하다. 빛의 에너지는 광자의 개수와 각 광자의 주파수의 함수라고 볼 수 있다.

참고 : 빛 에너지 함수는 사실 E=nhv (energy = 광자 개수 x 플랑크 상수 x 주파수)이지만, [플랑크 상수 (Planck Constant)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant)까지 설명하기에는 너무 어려워진다. 자세한 사항은 이 [링크](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry_Textbook_Maps/Supplemental_Modules_(Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry)/Quantum_Mechanics/02._Fundamental_Concepts_of_Quantum_Mechanics/Wave-Particle_Duality) 참고.

빛 에너지가 광자 개수와 광자 에너지(주파수)에 의존된다는 사실은 20세기에 [맥스 플랑크 (Max Planck)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Planck)와 [알버트 아인슈타인 (Albert Einstein)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein)이 발견했다. 광자 개수와 광자 에너지의 상호의존성에 대한 발견은 우리가 빛의 에너지를 이해하는데 있어 많은 영향을 일으켰고, 빛과 물질의 상호작용에 대한 이해를 많이 변형시켰다. 이 상호작용을 더 이해하기 위해서는, 물질은 원자 (Matter)로 이루어졌다는 사실과 함께 "광자가 원자와 어떤 상호작용을 일으킬까"라는 질문을 해야한다.

## 원자-광자 상호작용
To begin this discussion we need to first clarify what is an atom. As a result of many experiments we now know that stable matter, whether in gas or in liquid or in solid phase, is made of collections of so called atoms. Each atom in turn is made up of a very massive nucleus surrounded with less massive, but equally charged electrons. Measurements have verified that protons and neutrons make up the nucleus of the atom. These are of nearly the same mass and size particles. Their primary difference is that protons carry a positive electric charge, whereas the neutrons are, as suggested by their name, electrically neutron. Electrons are negatively charged and are 1/2,000 times less massive than their counter part protons/neutrons. As a result, almost all of the mass of the atom is due to its number of protons and neutrons. The role of the electron is to cancel out the positive electric charge in the nucleus. Since positive and negative charges attract, the electrons bind to the nucleus and in this combination create a neutral atom.

If the protons are positively charged and therefore repel each other by their electric interaction, then how do they come together to form the nucleus; and how do they hold on to neutrons, and the neutrons to each other? The answer turns out to be in the secret of the nucleus: another much stronger force, called the hadronic force, is involved. Protons and neutrons, called nucleons, strongly attact as a result of this hadronic force when they are very close to each other. This force of attraction is much much larger than the electric force, but it falls off very quickly when the nucleons begin to separate; i.e. it has a short range of interaction. As soon as the separation distance between two protons increases, this hadronic force becomes smaller than the electric repulsion and the two protons separate from each other. Of course, two neutrons, or a proton and a neutron, have no repulsive forces. So, they continue to attract each other, but only very weakly once they begin to separate; again because the hadronic force has a "short range". In passing, it is worthwhile to mention that it is the "harnessing" of the hadronic force that provides for the nuclear energy. So, when people are talking about "atomic energy" they are really preferring to the energy within the nucleus of the atom and not the energy that holds the electrons of the atom bound to its nucleus.

When light falls onto an atom the oscillations of the electromagnetic wave causes the electron to oscillate. In this fashion the atom absorbs the energy of the light. If this atom now interacts with other atoms it can pass along the photon energy (wave oscillations). This can happen in several different scenarios. One of these is that the energy is passed on without any loss. This is clearly an ideal 100% reflection or a 100% ideal transmission. In another scenario some of the light's energy could be "used" before it is transmitted to the next atom. This scenario clearly represent absorption followed by reflection/transmission. But what happens to light when it falls onto an isolated atom? The answer to this question, turns out, to be totally anti-intuitive and somewhat beyond the realm of our understanding of macroscopic world. It is answered by quantum physics. It turns out that very small atoms form a bound structure that can absorb energy and still remain a cohesive unit provided that the energy amount is just right. If the energy amount is not of the "correct" value the atom does not absorb it at all. In the context of quantum physics these "correct" energy values create a set of energy quanta (chunks). So, it is said that the atom's energy are quantized. This is, of course, in contrast to a macroscopic case, say a child on a swing, that could absorb any value energy - any light or any strong push. So, if the photon's frequency (wavelength) is not just right, the atom totally ignores photon's presence.

Historically, it was the absorption/emission of light by individual atoms in a vapor that gave the first clues to the quantum nature of atoms. Because the atoms in a vapor tend to be very far away from one another, for all practical purposes they can be considered as isolated atoms. It was observed that when light that included photons of many energies (frequency/wavelength) was shined on an atomic vapor only very specific wavelengths of the light were absorbed. Equally, when the atomic vapor was energised (say by a high voltage source or by collisions with other atoms) it just emitted discrete wavelengths of light. Below picture shows light emitted from a tube containing hydrogen atoms in a vapor. A diffraction grating is used to separate the light of different wavelength. Notice that there are only three distict colors (wavelength/frequencies) that are visible. There is not a contnium of colors, as we see being emitted from the sun, for example.
