# The Scent of a Molecule
- A study at Rockefeller University led by sensory scientists recruited 49 volunteers to rate the smells of 476 chemicals. The subjects ranked the intensity and pleasantness of each, then classified the scents using 19 descriptors, including fish, sour, sweaty, bakery, and decayed. The scientists also mapped out the chemical geometry of all the molecules, including the identity of every atom within them.
- For further research, the Rockefeller team put a challenge on __the DREAM Challenges__ to develop an AI that can find correlations in their data between odor and chemical structure.
- 18 teams accepted the challenge, and groups from University of Michigan and Arizona State University developed the most accurate algorithms.
- The Rockefeller team gathered input from all the teams (that participated in the challenge) to further investigate the chemical nature of smell.
- Trend 1 : small molecules tended to produce much more intense smells than large ones.
- Trend 2 : having polar groups within the molecule (regions of strong positive or negative charge), such as phenols, enols, and carboxyls, retched up the smell's intensity.
- Trend 3 : the smell of 3-methyl-cyclohexanone (a camphor-like odor) and ethyl heptanoate (sweet grape) was easiest to predict when matching odors to structures.
- Trend 4 : the 19 broad descriptions of odors fell into two clusters, those hard to guess (wood, urinous, musky), and those easy to guess (fruit, spices, burnt, garlic).
- Trend 5 : the presence of sulfur atoms is strongly associated with garlic smells.
- Trend 6 : Tellurium (element 52) smells like garlic, and is two spots below sulfur on the periodic table (hinting at the fact that nearby elements have similar smell, perhaps?)
- Trend 7 : Subunits of larger, more complicated molecules doesn't seem to interact much. Instead, each part produces an odor more or less independently of other parts. The overall smell is therefore the simple sum of each autonomous section.
- While the algorithms were able to link structure to odor for 8 of the descriptors, the other 11 remain mysterious.
- The study covers 476 scents, which is only a fraction compared to the number of real scents.
- some descriptors may not be so accurate; perceived traits, such as pleasantness or intensity, could vary among people with different genes or from different cultures.

## Notes
- the article does not mention any source, however, a brief research into the Rockefeller university website shows that they have done several smell studies. [This](https://www.rockefeller.edu/news/18664-crowdsourcing-effort-helps-researchers-predict-how-a-molecule-will-smell/) is one of them.
- I need to verify the information above, and put them down as individual notes.
