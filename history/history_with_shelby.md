# Big History
[Big History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_History) is an academic discipline which examines history from the Big Bang to the present. Big History resists specialization, and searches for universal patterns or trends. It examines long time frames using a multidisciplinary approach based on combining numerous disciplines from science and the humanities, and explores human existence in the context of this bigger picture. It integrates studies of the cosmos, Earth, life, and humanity using empirical evidence to explore cause-and-effect relations.

# History of Earth
The [History of Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Earth) concerns the development of planet [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) from its formation to the present day, characterized by constant geological change and biological evolution.

The [Geological Time Scale (GTS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geologic_time_scale) is a representation of time based on the rock record of Earth. It is a system of [chronological dating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronological_dating) that uses [chronostratigraphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronostratigraphy) (the process of relating [strata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratum) to [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time)) and [geochronology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geochronology) (scientific branch of geology that aims to determine the age of rocks).

The illustration below is an alternate representation of the GTS represented as a clock. [Alternative form of SI Unit of Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#SI_prefix_multipliers) is used in the illustration.
- Ka (Kiloannus) - One Thousand Years
- Ma (Megaannus) - One Million Years
- Ga (Gigaannus) - One Billion Years

# Human Evolution
[Human evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_evolution) is the evolutionary process within the history of primates that led to the emergence of Homo sapiens (aka Humans) as a distinct species of the [hominid (aka great apes)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hominidae) family, which includes the great apes. This process involved the gradual development of traits such as human bipedalism and language, as well as interbreeding with other hominis, which indicate that human evolution was not linear but a web.

# Human History
Human History (aka World History) is the narrative of Humanity's past. Humanity's written history was preceded by its prehistory, beginning with the Paleolithic ("Old Stone Age") era.

## Prehistory
[Prehistory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehistory) (aka pre-literary history) is the period of human history between the use of the first stone tools by hominins and the beginning of Recorded History with the invention of writing systems.

## Recorded History
Recorded History (aka Written History) describes the historical events that have been recorded in a written form or other documented communication which are subsequently evaluated by historians using the historical method.

## Eutherians (Placental Mammals)
Eutherians are commonly called placental mammals because their placentas are more complex than those of marsupials. Compared to marsupials, eutherians have a longer period of pregnancy. Young eutherians complete their embryonic development within the uterus, joined to their mother by the placenta. The eutherian placenta provides an intimate and long-lasting association between the mother and her developing young.

The living orders of eutherians originated in the late Cretaceous period.
