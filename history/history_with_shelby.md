# Human History


## Human Evolution
[Human evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_evolution) is the evolutionary process within the history of primates that led to the emergence of Homo sapiens (aka Humans) as a distinct species of the [hominid (aka great apes)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hominidae) family, which includes the great apes. This process involved the gradual development of traits such as human bipedalism and language, as well as interbreeding with other hominis, which indicate that human evolution was not linear but a web.

## Eutherians (Placental Mammals)
Eutherians are commonly called placental mammals because their placentas are more complex than those of marsupials. Compared to marsupials, eutherians have a longer period of pregnancy. Young eutherians complete their embryonic development within the uterus, joined to their mother by the placenta. The eutherian placenta provides an intimate and long-lasting association between the mother and her developing young.

The living orders of eutherians originated in the late Cretaceous period.
