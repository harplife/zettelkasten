# History of Earth
The [History of Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Earth) concerns the development of planet [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) from its formation to the present day, characterized by constant geological change and biological evolution.

The [Geological Time Scale (GTS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geologic_time_scale) is a representation of time based on the rock record of Earth. It is a system of [chronological dating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronological_dating) that uses [chronostratigraphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronostratigraphy) (the process of relating [strata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratum) to [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time)) and [geochronology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geochronology) (scientific branch of geology that aims to determine the age of rocks).

The illustration below is an alternate representation of the GTS represented as a clock. Ma stands for Megayear, which means a million years. Ga stands for Gigayear, which means a billion years.

# Human History

## Human Evolution
[Human evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_evolution) is the evolutionary process within the history of primates that led to the emergence of Homo sapiens (aka Humans) as a distinct species of the [hominid (aka great apes)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hominidae) family, which includes the great apes. This process involved the gradual development of traits such as human bipedalism and language, as well as interbreeding with other hominis, which indicate that human evolution was not linear but a web.

## Eutherians (Placental Mammals)
Eutherians are commonly called placental mammals because their placentas are more complex than those of marsupials. Compared to marsupials, eutherians have a longer period of pregnancy. Young eutherians complete their embryonic development within the uterus, joined to their mother by the placenta. The eutherian placenta provides an intimate and long-lasting association between the mother and her developing young.

The living orders of eutherians originated in the late Cretaceous period.
