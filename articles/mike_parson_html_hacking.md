# A governor says looking at webpage's HTML is hacking
Mike Parson, a governor (R) from Missouri USA, threatened to prosecute a journalist for "Decoding HTML source code".

This happened after the journalist reported a vulnerability in an official Department of Elementary and Secondary Education website - people's Social Security Number was exposed right on the HTML.

## My Thoughts
There are two things that are ridiculous:
1. Mike thinks looking at a webpage's HTML is hacking
2. Instead of thanking the journalist, Mike threatened them instead
3. Somebody, likely a programmer, legit thought exposing SSN on HTML was fine.

The [CFAA](https://codes.findlaw.com/us/title-18-crimes-and-criminal-procedure/18-usc-sect-1030.html) (Computer Fraud and Abuse Act) defines hacker as "(whoever) intentionaly accesses a computer without authorization or exceeds authorized access".

Any web content, including the HTML source code, is literally PUBLISHED with authorized access to all people with internet. Unless the content was protected via login and the journalist got access to it somehow, it is not at all hacking.

It seems obvious that Mike doesn't know what HTML is, or if he does, he doens't understand what hacking means.

Mike is an egotistical, arrogant fool who is not grateful that someone pointed out a vulnerability. Like, dude, even if it was hacking, you should be grateful for that the vulnerability was not exposed until after it was fixed. Even then, I'm sure the journalist tipped them to make sure that they fix it.

Lastly, the fact that a developer thought exposing a private information on a web service was fine, is so ridiculous. Dude, it's a Social Security Number. It should be raising red flags left and right. A project manager on that is a dumbass too.

This should serve as a reminder to anybody who works in [[computer_science|Computer Science]] or [[data_science|Data Science]].
