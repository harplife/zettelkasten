# Elon Musk fires his long time assistant
Refer to this [article](https://medium.com/illumination/why-elon-musk-fired-his-long-term-assistant-who-asked-for-a-raise-97e87ebb5cab), posted on 2021 Oct 26, by S M Mamunur Rahman, on Medium "Business & Economy".

## Highlights
- Mary Beth Brown had worked for Elon Musk for 12 years (until she was fired in 2014)
- This article is about how MB got fired, and what we should learn from it.
- The story about how MB got fired is from a book _"Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future"_ by Ashlee Vance.
- (supposedly) MB asked for a raise, and in response, Elon Musk told her to take two weeks' vacation and he will assess whether the raise is justifiable. Then, when MB got back from vacation, she was fired (for the reason below).
- (supposedly) Elon wanted to test the theory that, if MB is critical to the operation (SpaceX), then the operations would not operate in her absence (or something to that effect). After two weeks in her absence, Elon concluded MB was no longer critical to the operation.
- The story (or _Anecdote_) of MB being fired was refuted by Elon Musk on Aug 11, 2017 with his [tweet](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/895835433363439616), "Of all the bogus anecdotes, this one troubles me the most. Ashlee never actually ran this story by me or my assistant. It is total nonsense."
- In Elon's [tweet](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/895836885427335168), he further mentioned, "Mary Beth was an amazing assistant for over ten years, but <u>as company complexity grew, the role required several specialists vs. one generalist</u>."
