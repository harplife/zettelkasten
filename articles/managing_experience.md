# I Was a Terrible Manager
This is a note on the [article](https://index.medium.com/i-was-a-terrible-manager-not-1-not-2-but-3-times-936cd9dbf59f) about experience being a manger at big corporations, by Carlos Arguelles #todo 

This may go hand-in-hand with [[losing_microsoft_job|The Day I Lost my Job at Microsoft]]

## Highlights
- Carlos' first time managing a small group(3~5) of people at Microsoft from 2000 to 2003 was good; he puts it as "it just happened"
- After the Kaifu slashed a lot of his peers and the [KaiFu Defection Drama](https://www.cnet.com/news/microsoft-sues-over-google-hire/) happened, Carlos had a choice to keep managing or go back to being a Technical IC (Individual Contributor). He stayed a manager but he spiraled downward to almost being fired. At the time, he felt that going back to being an IC was like a demotion
- Carlos' became a manager at Amazon in 2012 temporarily because his manager went on a six month maternity leave.
- Amazon does performance reviews every six months, with scores in the range {Did Not Meet, Met, Exceeded, Outstanding}
- Carlos' managing experience at Amazon was stressful because Senior VP, Brian Valentine, decreed that if any engineer got two DNs in a row, that person's manager would get a DN
- Carlos' learned that he was good at helping good engineers to become great, but was bad at helping struggling engineers to become good. He believes that's a skill a manager should have
- Carlos eventually went back to being a Senior/Principal Engineer. He prefers that over being a manager

## My Thoughts
- I wish that being an IC was a choice. I feel that S.Korea's work culture pushes people to become managers, which gives rise to problems like Peter Principle
