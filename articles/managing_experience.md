# I Was a Terrible Manager
This is a note on the [article](https://index.medium.com/i-was-a-terrible-manager-not-1-not-2-but-3-times-936cd9dbf59f) about experience being a manger at big corporations, by Carlos Arguelles #todo 

This may go hand-in-hand with [[losing_microsoft_job|The Day I Lost my Job at Microsoft]]

## Highlights
- Carlos' first time managing a small group(3~5) of people at Microsoft from 2000 to 2003 was good; he puts it as "it just happened"
- After the Kaifu slashed a lot of his peers and the [KaiFu Defection Drama](https://www.cnet.com/news/microsoft-sues-over-google-hire/) happened, Carlos had a choice to keep managing or go back to being a Technical IC (Individual Contributor). He stayed a manager but he spiraled downward to almost being fired. At the time, he felt that going back to being an IC was like a demotion
- Carlos' became a manager at Amazon in 2012 temporarily because his manager went on a six month maternity leave.
- Amazon does performance reviews every six months, with scores in the range {Did Not Meet, Met, Exceeded, Outstanding}
- Carlos' managing experience at Amazon was stressful because Senior VP, Brian Valentine, decreed that if any engineer got two DNs in a row, that person's manager would get a DN
- Carlos' learned that he was good at helping good engineers to become great, but was bad at helping struggling engineers to become good. He believes that's a skill a manager should have
- Carlos eventually went back to being a Senior/Principal Engineer. He prefers that over being a manager

## My Thoughts
- I wish that being an IC was a choice. I feel that S.Korea's work culture pushes people to become managers - regardless of the size of the company. It may be less prominent in foreign companies (as in Korean branch of companies that are based in countries other than SK), like Google. I have heard, for big corps like Hyundai, people are likely to be fired if they don't take project management tasks.
- This article is relatable to me because I do have to consider what I'm going to do with my career. I could become a generalist, a specialist, a manager, a teacher, or completely something else. For now, I do like the idea of becoming a specialist, and then becoming a teacher later on.
- Could this article be an example of Peter Principle? Carlos initially thought he had no choice but to become a manager in order to go up (to be promoted). He was good with handling 3~5 people, but he was not able to handle any more than that. He was not equipped to do so.
- There is a saying in S.Korea, "자리가 사람을 만든다", which translates as "the position changes a person". It means people will adapt to the position that they are at. If a person becomes a manager, then that person will adapt and learn what it takes to be a manager. I can't say I agree completely with this sentiment, but I do agree that people who takes on more responsibility, tends to become more careful. This is especially true for parents. I can't seem to find the origin for this phrase though - Korean blogs and news often mention a saying in Spain, "office changes manners", but I can't confirm that with any other source in English.
