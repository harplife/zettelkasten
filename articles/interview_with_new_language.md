# Interview with a new language
Read the [article](https://blog.momocentral.com/we-created-a-new-programming-language-just-for-our-interview-process-yes-were-crazy-f831a32b5620).

## Summary
[MomoCentral](https://momocentral.com/), a company that brokers freelancers, have made their own unique interview process.
They created a new [[programming_language|Programming Language]] called "MokoM", so that the interviewees would have to study their language ahead of time before the interview, and then take algorithmic tests using the language.

I think the fact that they would make their own language is pretty cool, not to mention it seems like an exotic and yet effective way of doing interviews.
