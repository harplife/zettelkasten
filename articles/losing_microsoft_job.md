# The Day I Lost my Job at Microsoft
Read the article [here](https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/the-day-i-lost-my-job-at-microsoft-anatomy-of-stasis-f0e2cd653e3a).

The article was posted at 2021/09/14.

## Highlights
- The author was fired from Microsoft at January 2009, due to [mass layoff](https://techcrunch.com/2009/01/22/sad-day-for-microsoft-5000-laid-off-earnings-and-revenues-down/).
- The author moved on to working at Amazon after getting laid off, which he finds as a good thing.
- The author thinks that he was unhappy working in Microsoft.
- The author thinks that he stopped growing in his career while in Microsoft.
- The author joined Microsoft in 1997, straight out of college. He loved it then.
- The author wrote related articles [Memories from working at Microsoft in the nineties](https://link.medium.com/DFtR2QNELgb), [The night I pulled an all-nighter for Bill Gates](https://link.medium.com/4CAMIrvF8gb), and [Patenting at Microsoft](https://link.medium.com/SeNroHB5Wgb).
- The author says the first five years at MS was amazing, but it declined due to Steve Ballmer. He calls it the [Lost Decade](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/business/2012/08/microsoft-lost-mojo-steve-ballmer).
- The author loves how Satya Nadella has turned MS all around.
- In 2007, the author joined Microsoft's RMG (Rich Media Group), a team that works on photography-related software. With his hobby in photography, he loved by the thought of it.
- The author says the project failed because 1) it was overfunded, and 2) it was outside Microsoft's DNA
- The author says Amazon understands that overfunding is bad, and "Frugality" is in Amazon's [Leadership Principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles).
- The RMG tried to compete with Adobe Lightroom by employing more engineers.
- Adobe built Lightroom in 18 months with 18 engineers.
- The RMG created a program called "[Icons of Imaging](https://news.microsoft.com/2006/06/29/microsoft-launches-icons-of-imaging-program-at-first-microsoft-pro-photo-summit-recognizing-present-and-future-leaders-in-photography-and-digital-imaging/)" where they partnered with world-class photographers like Bambi Cantrell, Reed Hoffmann, Denis Reggie, John Shaw, Matthew Jordan Smith, and Art Wolfe.
- The RMG had a full collection of Canon "L" lenses that they could borrow at anytime, like the 70-200mm f/2.8L (worth $2000).
- The author says every corporate has a DNA : Apple does _beautiful designs_, Microsoft does _serious enterprise_, Amazon does _web services_, Google does _crazy scale_, and Adobe does _Photography and Art_.
- The author had the "corporate DNA" epiphany in Germany, September 2008, at [Photokina](https://www.photokina.com/), a well-known tradeshow in the photo industry, while exhibiting [Microsoft Pro Photo Tools](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2008/09/19/microsoft-pro-photo-tools-2-released). The Microsoft's booth was right next to Adobe, and it looked painfully corporate-looking in comparison to Adobe.
- The author says he wasted his last 2 years in Microsoft doing nothing to advance. He regrets not taking advantages of the privileges provided by the company. He offers a thought exercise: "if I lost my job today, would I regret not having taken advantage of the opportunities this job gave me?"
- On 2008/12/31, the author sent his resume to Amazon and Google, then practiced coding questions.
- The author knew the layoffs were going to happen; the rumors were floating around Microsoft's Redmond campus for a couple of months.
- The RMG wasted two years without releasing a product to market.
- When the author was laid off, he was given 8 months of severance in a lump sum.
- The author studied coding interview questions full time for a month, and went through full loops at Amazon and Google.
- The author received offers from both Amazon and Google, significantly above what he was making at Microsoft.
- The author chose Amazon and had worked there for 11 years.
- The author grew from a Microsoft low level 62 to a Microsoft high level 67 (equivalent at Amazon).
- The author [worked hard, had fun and made history](https://sociomirrorcom.wordpress.com/2018/04/09/how-did-amazons-internal-slogan-work-hard-have-fun-make-history-originate/).
- The author was promoted to Principal in 2014.
- In 2020, the author joined Google as a Senior Staff Engineer.
- On January 22, 2009 when Microsoft HR came to let the author know he was getting laid off, he thought it was the worst thing that happened to him. But looking back, it was the best thing that happened to him.

## My Thoughts
The things I like about this article:
- it has very detailed description of the event(s)
- it provides an inside story
- it is genuine
- it is a priceless life story from a capable developer
- it has links to events, people, and even idioms
- not only is it full of useful information, it is thought provoking

There were a lot of things said in the article, but if I were to spark note it,
- Microsoft had a massive layoff in 2009.
- Microsoft had a bad time, the Lost Decade.
- Microsoft had a bad leader, Steve Ballmer.
- Microsoft had a bad idea, the RMG.
- Carlos Arguelles worked in Microsoft for almost 10 years (before he got laid off).
- Carlos Arguelles joined Amazon and worked 11 years.
- Carlos Arguelles joined Google in 2020.
