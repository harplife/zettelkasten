# Elon Musk's Favorite Interview Question
Read the [article](https://entrylevelrebel.medium.com/science-just-confirmed-elon-musks-favorite-interview-question-is-brilliant-2a1e328592f5).

## Summary
Elon Musk always asks "Tell me about some of the most difficult problems you worked on and how you solved them" in interviews. The reason behind that is because "the people who really solved the problem, they know exactly how they solved it".
(His exact words at World Government Summit 2017, [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGwRIzQvU-k))

This interview method is useful for sniffing out liars, as liars tend to avoid sharing details.
This is [backed by science](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S221136812030005X), as AIM (Asymmetric Information Management) Technique has shown to detect liars at 81% accuracy.

The AIM Technique is all about informing interviewees that more detailed statements are easier to accurately classify as genuine or fabricated, which encourages truth tellers to be verbally forthcoming and liars to be verbally withholding. #todo make as a separate note

## My Thoughts
- The author makes a statement that 1) Elon Musk was using the AIM Technique, 2) Elon Musk was using a question to find liars. I don't know if Elon informed the interviewee (about detail=truth). Based on the explanation about his question, it doesn't mention anything about lies. So it hardly seems like Elon was trying the AIM technique.
- The AIM technique (the study of it) just goes to show that it sucks to have bad memories..!
- The "difficult time" question is valid, in the sense that it's a thinker. I had thought before that this question was unfair (and it is to newbies), but considering it is not up to the interviewer to decide whether it's difficult, the interviewee is free to share any stories, I do think it is fair. It shows many things, like what the interviewee consider difficult, how the interviewee handles difficult situations, and how much awareness the interviewee has to the situation.
- I think I should think of the answer to the question for myself, for [[work|Work]].
