# Learn Anything Faster By Using The Feynman Technique
Read the [article](https://www.cantorsparadise.com/learn-anything-faster-by-using-the-feynman-technique-6565a9f7eda7).

## Highlights
- Dr. Feynman is a Nobel Prize Winner (1965).
- Dr. Feynman is an educator and a physicist.
- Dr. Feynman crated a mathematical theory that accounts for the phenomenon of superfluidity in liquid helium.
- Dr. Feynman had fundamental contributions to weak interactions such as beta decay.
- Dr. Feynman played a significant role in the development of quark theory by putting forward his Parton model of high energy proton collision processes.
- Dr. Feynman introduced basic new computational techniques and notations into physics.
- "A truer description would have said that Feynman was all genius and all buffoon. The deep thinking and the joyful clowning were not separate parts of a split personality… He was thinking and clowning simultaneously.” — Freeman Dyson, 1988 remark on Feynman.
- Dr. Feynman wrote three-volume books on physics called _The Feynman Lectures on Physics_, which are based on his lectures at Caltech during 1961~1963.
- Dr. Feynman [tweeted](https://twitter.com/proffeynman/status/1370595934191591430) "If you cannot explain something in simple terms, you don't understand it" on 2021/03/13.
- A biographical book on Dr. Feynman was published with the title "[The Great Explainer](https://www.amazon.com/Great-Explainer-Richard-Feynman-Profiles/dp/1599351137)".
- "He opened a fresh notebook. On the title page he wrote: NOTEBOOK OF THINGS I DON’T KNOW ABOUT. For the first but not last time he reorganized his knowledge. He worked for weeks at disassembling each branch of physics, oiling the parts, and putting them back together, looking all the while for the raw edges and inconsistencies. He tried to find the essential kernels of each subject." — James Gleick on his biography of Richard Feynman
- The Feynman Technique (of Learning) consists of 4 steps;
	1. Pick a topic you want to understand and start studying it
	2. Pretend to teach the topic
	3. Go back to the resource material when you get stuck
	4. Simplify and Organize

## Summary
Learn as though you have to teach the topic to a child.

## My Thoughts
I must've heard this "teach to learn" more than a hundred times now.

I've seen the Feynman Technique being implemented in school several times.

I've personally felt that teaching itself is a great experience - because it changes your perspective on how well you should understand the topic to teach somebody.

In that same aspect, working in a tech company and having to explain complex methods (in data science/computer science) to a sales person (who has zero understanding of the topic), it builds professionalism because I have to understand the topic completely in order to simplify, organize, and rephrase the words so that the person understands.

This should be a reminder on how I should [[study|Study]] and [[goal_bachelor_in_cs|Get a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science]].
