## My Thoughts
I feel like these quotes don't really provide much insight to [[programming_language|Programming]], but it is nice to see that people who have earned their reputation for their expertise in the programming world agree that code should be readable by people.

I especially like the quote by Why The Lucky Stuff. It's difficult not to be biased with my own code, especially my code style. As much as I try to be [[python|Python]]-ic #todo , and optimize based on time complexity, I can't help but making codes that only I understand, and at worst cases, I won't even understand my own code later when I look back at them. I should really try to create more.

#todo research about the people who have made these quotes.
