# How to run Obsidian on Linux
When you go to the homepage for [[what_is_obsidian|Obsidian]], the site will give you a download button that says "Get Obsidian for Linux (AppImage)". Click the button and an [[appimage|AppImage]] file will be downloaded. Then follow [[how_to_run_appimage|How to run an AppImage file]].
