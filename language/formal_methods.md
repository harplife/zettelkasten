# Formal Methods

#define [Formal Methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_methods) are mathematical techniques for specifying, modeling, and verifying software systems to ensure correctness, safety, and reliability.
- The point is to use logic and mathematics (as opposed to informal reasoning) to prove correctness of a system.

Formal methods employ a variety of theoretical computer science fundamentals, including :
- Logic calculi
- Formal languages
- Automata theory
- Control theory
- Program semantics
- Type systems
- Type Theory

Most formal methods include three core parts :
1. Formal Specification
2. Modeling
3. Verification

---
#define [Formal Specification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_specification) is a precise mathematical description of system behavior.
- It is written in logic, set theory, type theory, or algebra
- It defines required properties like correctness, safety, or consistency

---
#define A [Mathematical Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model) is an abstract description of a concrete system using mathematical concepts and language. The process of developing a mathematical model is termed **Mathematical Modeling**.

Modeling is an abstract representation of the system, such as :
- State machines
- Transition systems
- Logical formulas
- Algebraic models

---
#define [Formal Verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification) is the act of proving the correctness of a system with respect to a certain formal specification (or property).
- The verification of these systems is done by ensuring the existence of a formal proof of a mathematical model of the system.
