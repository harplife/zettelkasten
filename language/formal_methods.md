# Formal Methods

#define [Formal Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_science) is a branch of science studying disciplines concerned with abstract structures described by *formal systems*.

#define A [Formal System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_system) (Deductive System) is an abstract structure and formalization of an axiomatic system used for deducing, using rules of inference, theorems from axioms.

#define A [Formal Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language) is a language that uses a set of strings whose symbols are taken from a specific alphabet, and operations used to form sentences from them.
- Like languages in linguistics, formal languages generally have syntax and semantics.

#define [Formal Methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_methods) are mathematical techniques for specifying, modeling, and verifying software systems to ensure correctness, safety, and reliability.
- The point is to use logic and mathematics (as opposed to informal reasoning) to prove correctness of a system.
- #define In theoretical computer science, an algorithm is [correct](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correctness_(computer_science)>) with respect to a specification if it behaves as specified.

Formal methods employ a variety of theoretical computer science fundamentals, including :
- Logic calculi
- Formal languages
- Automata theory
- Control theory
- Program semantics
- Type systems
- Type Theory

Most formal methods include three core parts :
1. Formal Specification
2. Modeling
3. Verification

#define [Formal Specification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_specification) is a precise mathematical description of system behavior.
- It is written in logic, set theory, type theory, or algebra
- It defines required properties like correctness, safety, or consistency

A good specification must have some of the following attributes :
- Adequate
- Internally consistent
- Unambiguous
- Complete
- Satisfied Minimal

A good specification will have :
- Constructability, manageability, and evolvability
- Usability
- Communicability
- Powerful and efficient analysis

Implementations of formal specifications will differ depending on :
- What kind of system they are attempting to model
- How they are applied
- At what point in the software life cycle they have been introduced

Specification paradigms :
- History-based specification
- State-based specification
- Transition-based specification
- Functional specification
- Operational specification
- Multi-paradigm languages

#define A [Specification Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_language) is a formal language in computer science used during systems analysis, requirements analysis, and systems design to describe a system at a much higher level than a programming language.
- An important use of specification languages is enabling the creation of proofs of program correctness.

Specification languages include :
- VDM
- Z notation
- TLA+

#define A [Mathematical Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model) is an abstract description of a concrete system using mathematical concepts and language. The process of developing a mathematical model is termed **Mathematical Modeling**.

Modeling is an abstract representation of the system, such as :
- State machines
- Transition systems
- Logical formulas
- Algebraic models

---
#define [Formal Verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification) is the act of proving the correctness of a system with respect to a certain formal specification (or property).
- The verification of these systems is done by ensuring the existence of a formal proof of a mathematical model of the system.


## Vienna Development Method

#define The [Vienna Development Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_Development_Method) (VDM) is one of the longest-established formal methods for the development of computer-based systems, originating from IBM Laboratory Vienna in the 1970s.
