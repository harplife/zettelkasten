# Linguistic Relativity

#definition The [Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity) is an idea that proposes that the language a person speaks shapes their cognition, perception, and view of the world.
- It suggest that grammatical structures and vocabulary influence thought.
- This idea is broken down into two ideas; *Linguistic Determinism* and *Linguistic Relativity*.

#definition The **Linguistic Determinism** is a "strong" version of the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis that states that language dictates thought.
- "We can't think about concepts of which we don't have words for".
- Pretty much a defunct idea.

#definition The **Linguistic Relativity** is a "weak" version of the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis that states that language influences thought (not so much as dictate).
- "We can think about concepts of which we don't have words for, it's just that we think more easily about the concepts of which we have words for".

> [!important] Linguistic Relativity is highly favored over Linguistic Determinism.


## Mechanisms of Linguistic Relativity

Mechanisms of Linguistic Relativity
- Categorical Perception
- Attentional Bias
- Memory Encoding and Recall
- Perceptual Speed and Efficiency
- Spatial Perception and Navigation
- Temporal Perception
- Object Salience and Categorization
- Sensory Feature Weighting
- Emotional Perception and Evaluation
- Social Perception
- Causal Perception and Agency
- Cross-Modal Perception
- Cultural Perceptual Calibration
- Top-Down Neural Modulation

Linguistic relativity affects perception by :
- guiding attention
- sharpening categories
- biasing memory and interpretation
- speeding up perception
- modulating sensory processing


### Categorical Perception

What happens
- Continuous sensory input is divided into discrete categories shaped by language.

Examples
- Color boundaries (blue vs. green, light vs. dark blue in Russian)
- Phoneme perception (e.g., /r/ vs. /l/ in English vs. Japanese)

Effect
- Faster and more accurate discrimination across linguistic boundaries
- Slower discrimination within the same linguistic category

Key idea
- Language sharpens *category edges*, not sensory ability.


### Attentional Bias

What happens
- Language directs habitual attention toward certain features of the environment.

Examples
- Absolute spatial languages (north/south instead of left/right)
- Languages with obligatory evidential markers (source of information)

Effect
- Speakers routinely notice and remember features their language requires them to encode.

Key idea
- You pay attention to what your language forces you to talk about.


### Memory Encoding and Recall

What happens
- Linguistic categories influence how experiences are stored and retrieved.

Examples
- Remembering colors better when they cross a named boundary
- Remembering events differently depending on grammatical tense or aspect

Effect
- Language affects what details *are remembered*, not what is perceived initially.


### Perceptual Speed and Efficiency

What happens
- Linguistic labels speed up perceptual decisions.

Examples
- Faster color discrimination when colors have different names
- Faster object identification when a lexical label is available

Effect
- Reduced cognitive load during perception

Key idea
- Language acts as a cognitive shortcut.


### Spatial Perception and Navigation

What happens
- Linguistic reference systems influence spatial reasoning.

Examples
- Absolute (cardinal) vs. relative (left/right) spatial terms
- Use of uphill/downhill or seaward/landward systems

Effect
- Improved orientation and navigation skills aligned with the linguistic system


### Temporal Perception

What happens
- Language frames how time is conceptualized and mentally organized.

Examples
- Tense-heavy languages vs. tenseless languages
- Spatial metaphors for time (horizontal vs. vertical timelines)

Effect
- Differences in how people order events or reason about duration


### Object Salience and Categorization

What happens
- Grammatical categories make certain object properties salient.

Examples
- Grammatical gender
- Classifier systems (shape, material, animacy)

Effect
- Speakers are biased to associate objects with culturally meaningful properties.


### Sensory Feature Weighting

What happens
- Language influences which sensory dimensions matter most.

Examples
- Shape-based vs. material-based noun classification
- Sound symbolism influencing perceived size or texture

Effect
- Certain sensory cues are prioritized over others.


### Emotional Perception and Evaluation

What happens
- Emotion vocabularies shape emotional discrimination.

Examples
- Languages with many emotion terms (e.g., shame vs. guilt distinctions)
- Culture-specific emotional concepts

Effect
- Finer emotional differentiation and awareness


### Social Perception

What happens
- Linguistic markers encode social relationships.

Examples
- Formal vs. informal pronouns
- Honorific systems

Effect
- Heightened sensitivity to social hierarchy and politeness norms


### Causal Perception and Agency

What happens
- Grammatical structures influence how events are interpreted.

Examples
- Languages that encode agency explicitly vs. implicitly
- Passive vs. agentless constructions

Effect
- Differences in blame attribution and responsibility judgments


### Cross-Modal Perception

What happens
- Linguistic metaphors link different sensory domains.

Examples
- High vs. low pitch described spatially
- Bright vs. dark sounds

Effect
- Language shapes how sensory modalities interact.


### Cultural Perceptual Calibration

What happens
- Language reinforces culturally important distinctions.

Examples
- Snow terms in Arctic cultures
- Plant and animal classification in Indigenous languages

Effect
- Fine-grained perception in ecologically relevant domains


### Top-Down Neural Modulation

What happens
- Language areas influence sensory cortex activity.

Evidence
- Stronger neural responses when categories are linguistically distinct
- Left-hemisphere language regions modulating visual perception

Effect
- Language actively shapes perceptual processing in real time.


## Examples of Linguistic Relativity

#example **Color Perception** (Russian Blue): Russian speakers distinguish between light blue (goluboy) and dark blue (siniy) as two completely different colors, unlike English speakers who treat both as blue. Consequently, Russian speakers are faster and more accurate at differentiating these shades in experiments.

#example **Gendered Objects** (German/Spanish): Languages that assign genders to objects, such as German and Spanish, cause speakers to describe items based on gendered stereotypes. For instance, a "key" (feminine in German) might be described as "delicate" or "shiny," while Spanish speakers, for whom it is masculine, might describe the same object as "hard" or "jagged".

#example **Spatial Navigation** (Directional Language): Some languages (like Guugu Yimithirr) do not use relative terms like "left" or "right," but rather cardinal directions (north, south, east, west). Speakers of such languages have an incredible, constant sense of orientation, even in unfamiliar places.

#example **Future Tense and Savings** (Financial Behavior): Research suggests that speakers of languages that do not strongly grammatically distinguish the future from the present (e.g., German) tend to save more money, as their language makes the future feel more connected to the present than languages with strict future tenses (e.g., English).

#example **Vocabulary for Environment** (Inuit Snow): While sometimes exaggerated, the principle holds that languages with specialized vocabulary for specific elements—such as the various words for snow in Inuit dialects—allow speakers to categorize and perceive environmental nuances more finely than speakers of languages with limited terms.

#example **Relationship to Time** (Left-to-Right): Languages written from left to right (like English) lead speakers to conceptualize time as moving from left to right, whereas languages written right-to-left, or vertically, foster different cognitive layouts of chronological events. 


## Relativist vs. Universalist

When it comes to linguistic relativity, there are two opposing perspectives :
- Relativist
- Universalist

The **relativist** perspective argues that language influences our perception, therefore we all (groups separated by different languages) experience different worlds.
- "strong" version argues that language directly shapes concept, which shapes our experience, which translates to different worlds
- "weak" version argues that language influences pre-existing concept & new concept can form, which shapes our experience, which translates to different worlds

The **universalist** perspective argues that language does not influence our perception, therefore we all experience the same world.
- Different languages just mean different labels for the same pre-existing concepts.


## Interactionist

This is a view held by Dr. Antonio Benitez-Burraco, in his article in Psychology Today ([source](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-biolinguistic-turn/201702/how-the-language-we-speak-affects-the-way-we-think)). It can be interpreted as the modern take on linguistic relativity.

> [!important] The term "interactionist" is not an official term for this view. However, it is fitting.

The **interactionist** perspective argues that we share a *universal* foundation for perception and thought, but language *influences* how we focus, organize, and attend to aspects of reality.
- It sees both universalist and relativist perspectives as "half-right".

Language **does not limit perception**, but it **enhances discrimination along linguistically defined boundaries**.
- #example while speakers of all languages can distinguish colors regardless of language, people are better at distinguishing colors that have different names in their language. This is supported by neuroscience.

<center>. . .</center>

Language make certain distinctions more **cognitively salient**, which affects behavior and skills.
- #xample (Counting) Chinese-speaking children learn numbers earlier because the number system is more regular ("ten one" instead of "eleven").
- #example (Spatial orientation) Some languages use absolute directions (north/south/west/east) instead of relative (left/right/up/down). Speakers of such languages become exceptionally good at orientation because their language requires constant awareness of direction.

<center>. . .</center>

Languages **guide attention** and **highlight what matters to their cultures**, by lexicalization and grammaticalization.

#define [Lexicalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicalization) : The linguistic process by which new words, concepts, or set phrases are added to a language's vocabulary, or when multi-word expressions become established as single lexical units.
- #define [Lexicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicon) : The vocabulary of a language or branch of knowledge.
- #define **Focal Vocabulary** (aka Jargon) : A specialized set of terms and distinctions that are particularly important to a specific culture, group, or activity, reflecting their unique experiences, environment, or expertise.

#define [Grammaticalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammaticalization) : The linguistic process in which words change from representing objects or actions to serving grammatical functions (content words developing into new function words).

(Lexicalization) Words exist for concepts that are culturally important. New words are added for new needs, and old words disappear when objects or practices vanish. Different cultures therefore have very different lexicons.

(Grammaticalization) Some distinctions are embedded deeply in grammar and must be considered whenever you speak. In other words, grammar forces speakers to habitually attend to certain dimensions of experience.
- #example Dyirbal noun classes : noun categories reflect cultural beliefs and mythology.
- #example When it comes to time, English uses past/present/future tenses. However, Chinese language does not have tenses based on time - instead, they first give context to time.



## Concepts to Learn


- #definition [Lethologica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tip_of_the_tongue) ("tip-of-the-tongue") : Temporary inability to retrieve a word from memory.
- #definition **Aphasia** : A language disorder affecting expression, understanding, reading, or writing due to brain damage.
	- ![[Pasted image 20260208145934.png]]
- #definition [Hypocognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypocognition) : Lacking the linguistic or cognitive representation for an idea (lacking the word to describe the concept).



## Application of Linguistic Relativity

### Computer Engineering

#### 1. Lexicalization to Attentional Bias

Deliberately learn and use precise technical terms instead of vague ones.

Example

Instead of  "The program is slow", use :
- "memory-boud"
- "cache-miss heavy"
- "branch-mispredict dominated"
- "I/O-latency limited"

Having a word forces you to :
- Notice the phenomenon
- Separate it from others
- Reason about it precisely

Summary :
- More words = finer perceptual resolution in problem space

#### 2. Categorical Perception

Name patterns, not just solutions

Learn names for recurring patterns in :
- Algorithms
- Concurrency
- Bugs
- Architecture

Example

- "Race condition"
- "False sharing"
- "Priority inversion"
- "N+1 query problem"
- "ABA problem"

Once a pattern is named :
- You recognize it faster
- You avoid rediscovering it
- You can transfer knowledge across contexts


#### 3. Grammaticalization to Obligatory Encoding

Use language to force attention to hidden dimensions.

Create mandatory checklists or sentence frames when reasoning.

When designing a system, force yourself to complete :
- The time complexity bottleneck is ..
- The space complexity tradeoff is ..
- The failure mode under load is ..
- The security assumption here is ..

By mimicking grammatical obligation :
- Just like some language force speakers to encode time or evidence, you force yourself to encode performance, safety, and scalability.


#### 4. Top-Down Modulation & Cognitive Offloading

Externalize thought with diagrams and pseudocode

Translate thoughts into :
- Precise variable names
- Pseudocode
- State machines
- Timing diagrams

Language (including formal notations) reshapes :
- What you attend to
- What inconsistencies become visible


#### 5. Frame Shifting

Switch linguistic frames deliberately.

Describe the same problem in multiple languages :
- Algorithmic language (inputs, outputs, invariants)
- Systems language (latency, throughput, contention)
- Mathematical language (state space, mappings)
- User-facing language (what breaks if this fails?)

Each frame highlights different aspects of reality.


#### 6. Cross-Modal and Metaphorical Mapping

Adopt metaphors intentionally, not accidentally :
- Memory as Hierarchy vs. Pipeline
- Threads as Workers vs. Resources
- Programs as Flows vs. States

Metaphors bias reasoning :
- Some make performance clearer
- Others hide failure modes


#### 7. Causal Perception & Agency

Improve debugging by linguistic precision

Avoid vague causal language :
- Instead of "the compiler broke", say "undefined behavior was triggered due to aliasing" or "data race caused non-deterministic write order"

Precise causal language :
- Reduces magical thinking
- Forces mechanistic explanations
- Leads to faster root-cause analysis


#### 8. Category Reinforcement

Train perception through code reviews

During reviews, explicitly label issues :
- Lifetime violation
- Invariant break
- API leakage
- Temporal coupling

Repeated linguistic labeling :
- Trains your perceptual system
- Turns slow reasoning into fast recognition


#### 9. Linguistic Diversity to Attentional Flexibility

Learn multiple programming languages for cognitive gain.

Expose yourself to languages with radically different constraints :
- C/C++ (memory & lifetimes)
- Rust (ownership & borrowing)
- Haskell (purity & types)
- Python (expressivity & dynamism)

Each language :
- Grammaticalizes different concerns
- Forces attention to different failure modes


#### 10. Language-Driven Thought Restructure

Use writing as a thinking tool

Write :
- Design docs
- Post-mortems
- "Explain it to a junior" notes

Language exposes gaps brutally and productively.


#### Formal Methods

See [[formal_methods|Formal Methods]].

Formal methods :
- Force explicit encoding of assumptions
- Remove ambiguity
- Change what you notice

They are like a programming language that :
- Grammaticalizes invariants
- Makes implicit assumptions illegal
- Forces attention to edge cases

In linguistic relativity terms, formal systems reshape cognition by restructuring the language in which you reason.

---
The practical path for learning formal methods is :
1. Learn basic logic (propositional + predicate logic)
2. Study Hoare logic
3. Learn TLA+ for distributed systems
4. Explore a proof assistant (Lean or Coq)

### International Phonetic Alphabet

[[International_Phonetic_Alphabet]] is a way to take linguistic relativity to my advantage.
- It shifts attention onto the pronunciations.
- It creates more salience onto the pronunciations.
- It helps understanding how a language works; from range of spoken consonants and vowels to patterns of phonetic features (e.g. stress, vowel reduction, etc.).

I want to use IPA in order to speak English better, but also to train my ears to hear words better and train my mouth to speak words better in general.

Then, I want to explore further with Korean - to understand how the consonants and vowels are interpreted and see how they differ from English. Then, I want to understand just how "English" accent can affect Korean.
- Once I'm comfortable with the way I speak Korean, maybe I can consider tutoring people with Korean.

By the time I master English and Korean, I'm hoping I'd be fluent in IPA to some degree. I want to learn Japanese and Spanish from then on.


### Universal Lexicon & Grammar

My theory is that by learning more languages, I'd be able to collect some lexicons (including focal vocabs) and grammars that aren't normally seen in English; in order to broaden my horizon and shift focus in a beneficial way.
