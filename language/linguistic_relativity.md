# Linguistic Relativity

#definition The [Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity) is an idea that proposes that the language a person speaks shapes their cognition, perception, and view of the world.
- It suggest that grammatical structures and vocabulary influence thought.
- This idea is broken down into two ideas; *Linguistic Determinism* and *Linguistic Relativity*.

#definition The **Linguistic Determinism** is a "strong" version of the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis that states that language dictates thought.
- "We can't think about concepts of which we don't have words for".
- Pretty much a defunct idea.

#definition The **Linguistic Relativity** is a "weak" version of the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis that states that language influences thought (not so much as dictate).
- "We can think about concepts of which we don't have words for, it's just that we think more easily about the concepts of which we have words for".

> [!important] Linguistic Relativity is highly favored over Linguistic Determinism.


## Relativist vs. Universalist

When it comes to linguistic relativity, there are two opposing perspectives :
- Relativist
- Universalist

The **relativist** perspective argues that language influences our perception, therefore we all (groups separated by different languages) experience different worlds.
- "strong" version argues that language directly shapes concept, which shapes our experience, which translates to different worlds
- "weak" version argues that language influences pre-existing concept & new concept can form, which shapes our experience, which translates to different worlds

The **universalist** perspective argues that language does not influence our perception, therefore we all experience the same world.
- Different languages just mean different labels for the same pre-existing concepts.


## Interactionist

This is a view held by Dr. Antonio Benitez-Burraco, in his article in Psychology Today ([source](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-biolinguistic-turn/201702/how-the-language-we-speak-affects-the-way-we-think)). It can be interpreted as the modern take on linguistic relativity.

> [!important] The term "interactionist" is not an official term for this view. However, it is fitting.

The **interactionist** perspective argues that we share a *universal* foundation for perception and thought, but language *influences* how we focus, organize, and attend to aspects of reality.
- It sees both universalist and relativist perspectives as "half-right".

Language **does not limit perception**, but it **enhances discrimination along linguistically defined boundaries**.
- #example while speakers of all languages can distinguish colors regardless of language, people are better at distinguishing colors that have different names in their language. This is supported by neuroscience.

Language make certain distinctions more **cognitively salient**, which affects behavior and skills.
- #xample (Counting) Chinese-speaking children learn numbers earlier because the number system is more regular ("ten one" instead of "eleven").
- #example (Spatial orientation) Some languages use absolute directions (north/south/west/east) instead of relative (left/right/up/down). Speakers of such languages become exceptionally good at orientation because their language requires constant awareness of direction.

Languages **guide attention** and **highlight what matters to their cultures**, by lexicalization and grammaticalization.

#define [Lexicalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicalization) : The linguistic process by which new words, concepts, or set phrases are added to a language's vocabulary, or when multi-word expressions become established as single lexical units.
- #define [Lexicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicon) : The vocabulary of a language or branch of knowledge.
- #define **Focal Vocabulary** (aka Jargon) : A specialized set of terms and distinctions that are particularly important to a specific culture, group, or activity, reflecting their unique experiences, environment, or expertise.

#define [Grammaticalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammaticalization) : The linguistic process in which words change from representing objects or actions to serving grammatical functions (content words developing into new function words).

(Lexicalization) Words exist for concepts that are culturally important. New words are added for new needs, and old words disappear when objects or practices vanish. Different cultures therefore have very different lexicons.
