# Linguistic Relativity

#definition The [Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity) is an idea that proposes that the language a person speaks shapes their cognition, perception, and view of the world.
- It suggest that grammatical structures and vocabulary influence thought.
- This idea is broken down into two ideas; *Linguistic Determinism* and *Linguistic Relativity*.

#definition The **Linguistic Determinism** is a "strong" version of the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis that states that language dictates thought.
- "We can't think about concepts of which we don't have words for".
- Pretty much a defunct idea.

#definition The **Linguistic Relativity** is a "weak" version of the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis that states that language influences thought (not so much as dictate).
- "We can think about concepts of which we don't have words for, it's just that we think more easily about the concepts of which we have words for".

> [!important] Linguistic Relativity is highly favored over Linguistic Determinism.
