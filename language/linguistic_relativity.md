# Linguistic Relativity

#definition The [Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity) is an idea that proposes that the language a person speaks shapes their cognition, perception, and view of the world.
- It suggest that grammatical structures and vocabulary influence thought.
- This idea is broken down into two ideas; *Linguistic Determinism* and *Linguistic Relativity*.

#definition The **Linguistic Determinism** is a "strong" version of the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis that states that language dictates thought.
- "We can't think about concepts of which we don't have words for".
- Pretty much a defunct idea.

#definition The **Linguistic Relativity** is a "weak" version of the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis that states that language influences thought (not so much as dictate).
- "We can think about concepts of which we don't have words for, it's just that we think more easily about the concepts of which we have words for".

> [!important] Linguistic Relativity is highly favored over Linguistic Determinism.


## Relativist vs. Universalist

When it comes to linguistic relativity, there are two opposing perspectives :
- Relativist
- Universalist

The **relativist** perspective argues that language influences our perception, therefore we all (groups separated by different languages) experience different worlds.
- "strong" version argues that language directly shapes concept, which shapes our experience, which translates to different worlds
- "weak" version argues that language influences pre-existing concept & new concept can form, which shapes our experience, which translates to different worlds

The **universalist** perspective argues that language does not influence our perception, therefore we all experience the same world.
- Different languages just mean different labels for the same pre-existing concepts.


## Interactionist

This is a view held by Dr. Antonio Benitez-Burraco, in his article in Psychology Today ([source](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-biolinguistic-turn/201702/how-the-language-we-speak-affects-the-way-we-think)). It can be interpreted as the modern take on linguistic relativity.

> [!important] The term "interactionist" is not an official term for this view. However, it is fitting.

The **interactionist** perspective argues that we all experience the world the same with all our senses, and language influences how we *process* our experience.
- It sees both universalist and relativist perspectives as "half-right".
- The "process" is the key operative term here.
