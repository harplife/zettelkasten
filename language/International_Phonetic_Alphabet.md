# International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)

## Definition and Purpose

#definition [Linguistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics) : The Scientific study of language.

#definition [Phonetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonetics) : A branch of linguistics that studies speech sounds, encompassing their production (articulatory), transmission (acoustic), and perception (auditory).

#definition [Phone](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_(phonetics)>) : (in phonetics) Any distinct speech sound.
- Phones are the [segments](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segment_(linguistics)>) of speech that possess distinct physical or perceptual properties, regardless of whether the exact sound is critical to the meanings of words.

#definition [Phonetic Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonetic_transcription) (Phonetic Transcription) : The visual representation of phones by means of symbols.

#definition [The International Phonetic Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) (IPA) :  an alphabetic system of phonetic notation based primarily on the Latin script.

> "IPA", transcribed according to received pronunciation as \[aɪ̯ pʰiː eɪ̯\].

---
The IPA is designed to represent the qualities of speech that are part of lexical sounds in spoken (oral) language. Those qualities are :
- **Phones**
- **Intonation**
- **The separation of syllables**

The general principle of the IPA is to provide one letter for each distinctive sound (phoneme). This means that :
- It does not use combinations of letters to represent single sounds (e.g. "sh", "ea"), nor single letters to represent multiple sounds (e.g. "x").
- In the strictest sense, there are no letters that have context-dependent sound values (e.g. "c" sounding like "case" or "cease", and "g" sounding like "game" or "germ"). Every single speech sound has their equivalent symbol.

IPA consists of :
- 107 letters representing consonants and vowels
- 31 [diacritics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic)
- 17 additional signs to indicate suprasegmental qualities, such as length, tone, stress, and intonation

## Basic Overview

### Syllable

#definition A **Syllable** is a basic unit of organization within a sequence of speech sounds (e.g. a word).

The general structure of a syllable consists of two components :
- Onset
- Rhyme

> [!warning] The structure of syllable is not "defined" in any sort of way. Different languages tend to have their own structure of a syllable.
> Most languages do often share the common structure of *onset* and *rhyme* though.

The two components of a syllable is usually separated by the *first vowel*. The **Onset** describes the sound (consonant) that comes before that vowel, and the **Rhyme** describes the vowel sound and the consonant sound that follows.

> [!important] The "rhyme" of a syllable is the part used in [poetic rhymes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhyme) (rhyming).
> The rhyme (of a syllable) is often spelled "rime" to distinguish it from the poetic rhyme.

Rhyme consists of two segments, Nucleus and Coda.
- **Nucleus** is usually a single vowel, but it can be a cluster of vowels or a syllabic consonant (more on this later).
- **Coda** is a single or cluster of consonant that follows the nucleus.

> [!important] A syllable must have a nucleus, but both onset and coda are *optional*.
> It is possible to have a syllable with just the nucleus, like "a" in "able (a-ble)".

> [!warning] When there are multiple syllables in a word, it may prove challenging to distinguish between onset and coda.
> There are some rules and constraints to help :
> - The "Greedy" Onset Rule
> - Phonotactic Constraints
> 
> There are exceptions though, so we just need to find what works.

#example Putting it together, we can use a single syllable to describe the sound of the word "dog" :
- The initial consonant "d" sound is the onset
- The "aw" sound is the nucleus
- The final "g" sound is the coda

We will be using the IPA letters to describe the sound of the onset, the nucleus, and the coda.

> [!important] We don't need to deconstruct component syllables and syllable components in order to use the IPA notation & letters.
> It's just good to be aware what syllable is, so that we can distinguish the sounds in a syllable.


### Phonemes and Allophones

A single **phone** (a smallest unit of speech sound) can be either *phonemic* or *phonetic*.

A [Phoneme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneme) is any set of similar speech sounds that are *perceptually* regarded as a single basic sound, which makes words *distinguishable* from one another. In other words, a phoneme is a distinguishable smallest unit (or cluster) of sound that differentiates meaning.
- #example In American English, the words "Cat" and "Pat" are differentiated because "C" and "P" are phonemes.

An [Allophone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allophone) is any set of *perceptually indistinguishable* speech sounds used to pronounce a single phoneme.
- #example In American English, the "t" sounds in the words "top", "water" and "mountain" are allophones. They all share the same phoneme "t", but they all sound slightly different.

<center>. . .</center>

In IPA, we use the **phonemic** transcription (using slashes `/ /`) when we describe sound by their abstract, distinct sound using *phonemes*. We use the **phonetic** transcription (using brackets `[ ]`) when we describe the actual sounds precisely and detailed (including subtle variations like allophones).

#example Going back to the words "top", "water", and "mountain", we can transcribe them phonemically or phonetically. Like so :
- top : `/tɑp/` or `[tʰɑp]`
- water : `/ˈwɔtər/` or `[ˈwɔɾɚ]`
- mountain : `/mɑntn/` or `[ˈmãʊ̃ʔn̩]`

Note that these words have `/t/` in common, but it is pronounced in three different ways -  "t" `[tʰ]`, "d/r" `[ɾ]`, or some kind of groaning sound `[ʔ]`. More on this later.

> [!important] "Perceived Sound" is an important factor in IPA.
> We all have our own unique dialects and accents, which means not all of us will pronounce the words the same. Not only that, our unique minds perceive things differently in our own unique ways, including sounds.
> 
> While IPA is used to describe speech sound systematically and in detail, it is not a perfect measurement of speech sound. Meaning, we aren't shooting for perfect representation of speech sound, and instead, we are trying to describe the sound as we hear and perceive them as best as possible.

Additionally, the angular brackets `⟨ ⟩` are used to indicate *graphemes* or spelling of a language in written text, rather than their phonetic sounds.
- #define A **Grapheme** is the smallest functional unit of a writing system, representing a single phoneme.
- #example The spelling of the word "cat" is indicated as `⟨cat⟩`. Each individual letters are `⟨c⟩`, `⟨a⟩`, and `⟨t⟩`.

### General American English

#definition **General American English** (GA or GenAM) is the umbrella accent of American English used by a majority of Americans, encompassing a continuum rather than a single unified accent. Basically, it is an accent of American English that lacks any distinctly regional, ethnic, or socioeconomic characteristics - which is used as a convenient basis for comparison.

We'll focus mainly on GA so that it keeps things simple - it will limit the amount of IPA letters we'd have to learn initially, and it will serve as a foundation for learning IPA letters meaningful for other languages.

Regardless of language, the speech sound is divided into two principal classes based on *obstruction of the vocal tract* :
- [Consonant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consonant) (obstructed sound)
- [Vowel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel) (unobstructed sound)

---
The majority of sounds in most languages are *pulmonic egressive sounds* - which is our main focus. From here on, when I mention consonants/vowels, I'm referring to pulmonic consonants/vowels.
- #definition [Pulmonic Egressive Sounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egressive_sound#Pulmonic_egressive) : Sounds produced through the mouth (or nose) using the air stream created by the lungs, ribs, and diaphragm.


### Consonants

#definition A **Consonant** is a speech sound that is articulated with complete or partial closure of the vocal tract.

IPA categorizes consonants based on three primary, articulatory features :
- [Place of articulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_of_articulation)
- [Manner of articulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manner_of_articulation)
- [Voicing](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_(phonetics)>)

---
**Voicing** refers to a classification of speech sounds that tend to be associated with vocal cord vibration but may not actually be voiced at the articulatory level. In other words, speech sounds can be described as either "voiced" or "voiceless (unvoiced)".

It's easier to understand with an example. When we make sound associated with the English letter "s", our vocal cord does not vibrate while "s" is pronounced. However, our vocal cord does vibrate when we pronounce "z".

There are other letter pairs that are voiced/voiceless, such as p/b, t/d, f/v, and more. Note that the letters in a pair are pronounced in the same way (place and manner), which we'll find out more about below.

---
**The Place of Articulation** is the approximate location in the vocal tract (e.g. lips, teeth, or palate) where the air stream is constricted/blocked to produce a consonant sound.

They are largely divided into four major parts :
- [Labial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labial_consonant) (lips)
- [Coronal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronal_consonant) (front part of the tongue)
- [Dorsal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsal_consonant) (back part of the tongue)
- [Laryngeal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngeal_consonant) (throat)

All the variations of the places of articulations are :

| Place of Articulation     | Articulators                                                                |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bilabial**              | Both lips                                                                   |
| **Labio-dental**          | Lower lip + upper teeth                                                     |
| **Linguo-labial**         | Tongue tip against upper lip                                                |
| **Dental**                | Tongue tip against upper teeth                                              |
| **Alveolar**              | Tongue tip against the superior alveolar ridge                              |
| **Post-alveolar**         | Tongue tip against back of the alveolar ridge                               |
| **Retro-flex**            | Tongue tip curled up against between the alveolar ridge and the hard palate |
| **Palatal**               | Tongue body against the hard palate                                         |
| **Velar**                 | Tongue body against the soft palate                                         |
| **Uvular**                | Tongue body against the uvula                                               |
| **Pharyngeal/epiglottal** | Tongue root against mid/upper pharynx                                       |
| **Glottal**               | Glottis                                                                     |

In the table above, I use the term "against" but it doesn't necessarily mean the articulators (organs) have to touch each other. A consonant can be produced by getting the articulators just near each other (without touching), in which case, the consonant is called an [Approximant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximant).

**The Manner of Articulation** describes *how* speech organs (e.g. tongue, lips, teeth) constrict or modify airflow in the vocal tract to produce consonant sounds.

Key manners of articulation include :

| Manner of Articulation | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Plosive (or Stop)**      | Oral occlusive; Blocking of the oral vocal tract and no nasal air flow, causing complete air flow stop. If the consonant is voiced, the voicing is the only sound made during occlusion; if it is voiceless, a stop is completely silent. However, we do hear the effect that the onset of the occlusion has on the preceding vowel, as well as the release burst and its effect on the following vowel. |
| **Nasal**                  | Nasal occlusive; Air passes through the nose while the oral tract is blocked. Majority of nasal consonants are voiced. Not to be confused with *nasalized consonant*.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Vibrant**                | One or more brief occlusions occur; a momentary closure of the oral cavity is called a *flap/tap*, whereas several momentary closure of the oral cavity (vibrating of the articulator) is called a *trill*.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Fricative (or Spirant)** | A continuous *frication* (turbulent and noisy airflow) at the place of articulation. Types of fricative include *Sibilant* Fricatives and *Lateral* Fricatives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Affricate**              | Begins like a stop but releases into a fricative rather than having a separate release of its own.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Approximant**            | Very little obstruction. Types of approximant include *Semivowel/Glide* and *Laterals*.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

#### Affricates

#define An [Affricate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affricate) is a consonant that begins as a stop and releases as a fricative, generally with the same place of articulation. GA has two affricate phonemes :
- `/d͡ʒ/` (j)
- `/t͡ʃ/` (ch)

While tie bar (arc) symbol above or below the two consonants is not necessary, but it helps to clarify.

#### Sibilants

#define A [Sibilant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sibilant) is a high-intensity, high-pitched fricative or affricate consonant produced by directing airflow with the tongue against the teeth. In other words, it is a "hissing" or "hushing" sound.

In GA, the sibilant consonants are :
- (fricatives) `/s, z, ʃ, ʒ/`
- (affricates) `/d͡ʒ, t͡ʃ/`

#### Interdental Consonants

#define An [Interdental Consonant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdental_consonant) is a consonant produced by placing the tip of the tongue between the upper and lower front teeth.
- This differs from typical dental consonants, which are articulated with the tongue against the *back* of the upper incisors.

In GA, the interdental consonants are :
- (fricatives) `/ð, θ/`

> [!important] Though these sound alike, these are distinct phonemes and not allophones.
> The distinction is more clear with these minimal pairs (`/θ/` - `/ð/`) :
> - thigh - thy
> - ether - either
> - teeth - teethe (teething)
> 
> There are some general rules to distinguish them, but we'll skip on that for now.

#### Liquids (Rhotic and Lateral)

#define A [Liquid Consonant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_consonant) (Liquid) is a unique, vowel-like consonant produced with partial, non-obstructive closure in the mouth. Liquids either *modify* or are *modified by* surrounding sounds, often influencing preceding vowels.

Liquids consists of *rhotics* and *voiced lateral approximants* :
- #define A [Rhotic Consonant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhotic_consonant) refers to "R-like" sound.
- #define A [Lateral Consonant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_consonant) refers to "L-like" sound, where the sound is produced by blocking the flow of air along the center of the mouth with the tongue (forcing the air to escape around the tongue).

<center>. . .</center>

In GA, the only rhotic consonant is the **voiced post-alveolar approximant** `/ɹ̠/`, used for the the English letter `⟨r⟩`. It is typically written as `/r/` (voiced alveolar trill) for convenience, but the main difference is that the tongue does not touch the alveolar.
- `/r/` is more prominent in Spanish languages. It is called a "rolling-R".
- #define The term "rhoticity" indicates whether an accent pronounces the `⟨r⟩`s. A rhotic accent pronounces it ("car" -> car), and non-rhotic accent doesn't ("car" -> cah).

<center>. . .</center>

In GA, there are *technically* two lateral consonants :
- **Voiced alveolar lateral approximant** `/l/`, aka "Light L"
- **Velarized alveolar lateral approximant** `/ɫ/`, aka "Dark L"

The sound `/l/` is produced by placing the tip of the tongue against the alveolar ridge to block the central airflow. Generally, this sound occurs before vowels (e.g. "light", "fly").

The sound `/ɫ/` is produced by velarization (without the tip of the tongue touching the alveolar). Generally, this sound occurs after vowels or at the end of words (e.g. "pool", "well").
- #define [Velarization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velarization) modifies the articulation of a consonant by raising the back of the tongue toward the velum.

Both  `/l, ɫ/` are *allophones* of `⟨l⟩`, so distinction between them does not change the meaning of the word. In fact, it can be said that `/l/` is the only lateral consonant because :
- the usage between the two comes down to *accent*
- `/l/` can replace `/ɫ/` for *enunciation* (e.g. "fill", "ball")
- `/ɫ/` is written as `/l/` for convenience


#### Allophones

We've covered before that an **allophone** is any set of indistinguishable speech sounds used to pronounce a single phoneme.

We're not going to cover every allophones of each phonemes in GA, but we'll cover the allophones of `/t/`.

In GA, `/t/` is rather particular and has more allophones than other phonemes.
- Aspirated "True" T `[tʰ]` : "top", "tap", "time", "talk", "train"
- Unaspirated T `[t]` (generally for `/st/`) : "stop", "star", "stick"
- Flapped T `[ɾ]` : "uh-oh", "coating", "betting", "atom", "bottle"
- Glottal/Nasal Release T `[ʔ]` : "button", "mountain", "curtain", "certain"
	- Emphatic/Coda T : "won't", "apartment", "lightbulb", "right now"
- Unreleased T `[t̚]` (word final, unaspirated) : "amount", "ancient", "cat", "goat", "vent", "patient"

> [!warning] Although google search is telling me that there is "regular" `/t/`, I'm not getting a sound explanation or example of such.
> It seems to me that `/t/` sounds differently based on where it is placed :
> - Initial (aspirated or unaspirated)
> - Middle (flap or stop)
> - Final (unreleased)

> [!important] The allophones of `/d/` are similar to the allophones of `/t/` in a few ways.
> - Alveolar Flap `[ɾ]` : "buddy", "leader"
> - Nasal Release : "hidden"

> [!important] In GA, phonemes like `/p, k/` have aspirated, unaspirated, and unreleased allophones.


### Vowels

#definition A Vowel is a speech sound produced with an open vocal tract, allowing air to flow freely without significant restriction from the articulators.
- All vowel sounds are voiced.
- 


#### Common GA Vowels & Examples

GA typically features **14-16 vowels**, (i, ɪ, eɪ, ɛ, æ, ɑ, ɔ, oʊ, ʊ, u, ʌ, ə, aɪ, aʊ, ɔɪ).

ɝ <-- r-colored vowel, stressed er sound for bird, nurse, learn
ɚ <-- r-colored vowel, unstressed er sound for teacher, color

#### Stresses

#define [Stress](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(linguistics)>) (or Accent) is the relative emphasis or prominence given to a certain syllable in a word or to a certain word in a phrase or sentence.
- This emphasis is made by increased loudness and vowel length, full articulation of the vowel, and changes in pitch/tone.

In the IPA, stress is marked by a vertical tick placed *before* the syllable.

A stress is described as either *primary* or *secondary*.

#define A **Primary Stress** marks the loudest/most prominent syllable in the word, and denoted with a raised tick `⟨ˈ⟩`.
- #example "Tomato" -> `/təˈmeɪ.toʊ/`, the "may" sound is the loudest.

#define A [Secondary Stress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_stress) marks the weaker but still noticeably loud syllable in the word, and denoted with a lowered tick `⟨ˌ⟩`.
- #example "Information" -> `/ˌɪn.fərˈmeɪ.ʃən/`, the "in" sound is slightly emphasized.

Typically, a **syllable break** `⟨.⟩` is used to indicate the division between syllables within a word. It makes transcription easier to read (it is mostly for convenience).
- When a stress is used in a word, a syllable break helps to distinguish unstressed syllables.

Absence of stress on a syllable, or on a word in some cases, is frequently associated with *vowel reduction*.
- #define [Vowel Reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel_reduction) refers to any change in the acoustic quality of vowels as a result of changes in stress, sonority, duration, loudness, articulation, or position in the word, which are perceived as "weakening". It often makes the vowels shorter.
- Many such syllables are pronounced with a centralized vowel (e.g. schwa `/ə/`) or with certain other vowels that are described as being "reduced" (or sometimes with a syllabic consonant as the syllable nucleus).

<center>. . .</center>

In GA, unstressed syllables are reduced in four different ways :
- Mid/Low Vowels to `/ə/`
- High Front/Back Vowels to `/ɪ/` or `/ə/`
- R-Colored Vowel Reduction `/ɚ/`
- Suffix Reduction


#example Mid/Low Vowels to `/ə/` :
- "About" : `/əˈbaʊt/`
- "Sofa" : `/ˈsoʊfə/`
- "Computer" : `/kəmˈpjuːtɚ/`
- "Official" : `/əˈfɪʃəl/`

#example High Front/Back Vowels to `/ɪ/` or `/ə/`
- "Decide" : `/dɪˈsaɪd/` (often /ɪ/ or /ə/)
- "Potato" : `/pəˈteɪtoʊ/` (first 'o' reduces)

#example R-Dissimilation
- Surprise
- Governor
- Caterpillar
- Library
- Particular
- Frustrated

#example R-Colored Vowel Reduction `/ɚ/`
- "Doctor" : `/ˈdɑːktɚ/`
- "Sister" : `/ˈsɪstɚ/`
- "Better" : `/ˈbɛtɚ/`

#example Suffix Reduction
- "Darkness" : `/ˈdɑːrk.nəs/` (reduces to `/nəs/`)
- "Important" : `/ɪmˈpɔːr.tənt/` (reduces to `/tənt/`) 

<center>. . .</center>


> [!important] Many languages have rhythmic stress.
> Location of the stress may not be predictable, but when the location of one stressed syllable (which may be the primary stress) is known, certain syllables before or after can be predicted to also be stressed (secondary stress).
> 
> However, it's not very predictable in English. Lol


While English is not strictly syllable-timed, stress patterns heavily influence vowel reduction, where unstressed vowels often become a schwa /ə/ or /ɪ/.

Key Patterns for English Stress:

- **Noun vs. Verb Pairs:** Many two-syllable words change meaning based on stress placement: Nouns typically stress the first syllable (_REcord_ /ˈrɛkərd/), while verbs stress the second (_reCORD_ /rɪˈkɔrd/).
- **Compound Nouns:** Often, the first element receives primary stress (e.g., _NEWspaper_ /ˈnuzˌpeɪpər/).
- **Two-Syllable Nouns/Adjectives:** Frequently stress the first syllable (e.g., _TABLE_ /ˈteɪbəl/, _HAPPY_ /ˈhæpi/).
- **Two-Syllable Verbs/Prepositions:** Frequently stress the second syllable (e.g., _DECIDE_ /dɪˈsaɪd/, _ABOUT_ /əˈbaʊt/).
- **Suffix Influence:** Words ending in _-tion_, _-sion_, _-ic_, and _-ity_ usually place primary stress on the syllable immediately preceding the suffix (e.g., _information_ /ˌɪnfərˈmeɪʃən/).
- **Length & Position:** Primary stress can fall on the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd syllable, making it essential to check the dictionary for unfamiliar words, as spelling does not always indicate stress placement.
- **Secondary Stress:** Often found in long words, particularly on the first or second syllable, preceding the primary stress (e.g., _monumental_ /ˌmɑnjəˈmɛntəl/).



### Special Consonants & Vowels

#### Assimilation

#todo assimilation of place, or of manner

#todo Word Boundary Assimilation

#todo Dentalization

> [!important] Omitting word boundary assimilation (assimilation in connected speech) is generally considered a form of clear, careful, or slow enunciation.
> - Ten bucks -> instead of "tem bucks", say ten. bucks.
> - want you -> instead of "wanchu", say want. you.
> - did you -> instead of "didju", say did. you.
> - bless you -> instead of "bleshu", say bless. you.


#### Co-articulated Consonants

#todo A [Co-articulated Consonant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-articulated_consonant) is a consonant produced by simultaneous (or rapidly overlapping) articulations of adjacent sounds, commonly resulting in labialization, velarization, nasalization, and palatalization.

#todo labialization
`/w/` and `/j/`

/w/: **wi**n, q**uee**n
- Sometimes **/ʍ/** or **/hw/** is used for "wh" sound where "h" sound is not prominent but it is still more "breathier" than "w" sound (e.g. *which* or *whale*).
/j/ (y): **y**es, **y**ou

#todo Yod Dropping after alveolar consonants
- `/j/` is dropped in stressed syllables after all alveolar and dental consonants (except `/p, b, f, h, k, m/`).
	- `/j/` is dropped after `/t,d,n,s,z,l/`
- This applies also to syllables often transcribed with the secondary stress mark `⟨ˌ⟩` (e.g. "avenue" `/ˈævəˌnu/`), but it is retained for unstressed syllables (e.g. "menu" `/ˈmɛnju/`).
- new, Tuesday, assume, duke, tune, due, suit

> [!note] This actually blows my mind. I've been saying all these words with yod all this time.


#todo velarization
light l and dark l (already covered this)
n to ŋ


#### Syllabic Consonants

#define A [Syllabic Consonants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllabic_consonant) is a consonant that function as the nucleus of a syllable, replacing an expected vowel (if there is one) in an unstressed (unaspirated), final syllable.

In GA, consonants such as `/n, m, r, l/` often acts as syllabic consonants.
- `/n/` : butt**on**, mount**ain**, hidd**en**
- `/m/` : rhyth**m**, pris**m**, bott**om**
- `/r/` : teach**er**, butt**er**, mot**or**
- `/l/` : bott**le**, litt**le**, fin**al**

Syllabic consonants are denoted with a small vertical line diacritic below the consonant symbol. Like so,
- `/n/` - `[n̩]`
- `/m/` - `[m̩]`
- `/r/` - `[ɹ̩]`
- `/l/` - `[l̩]`

> [!important] Precise phonetic accuracy is conveyed using diacritic. Meaning, phonetic transcription is used for syllabic consonants.
> The word "Button" could be transcribed phonemically `/ˈbʌtən/` and phonetically `[bʌtn̩]`.

In case of syllabic consonants, we can phonemically transcribe them with a preceding vowel `/ə/`.
- `/n/` - `/ən/` - "button" is `/ˈbʌtən/`
- `/m/` - `/əm/` - "rhythm" is `/ˈrɪðəm/`
- `/r/` - `/ər/` - "butter" is `/ˈbʌtər/`
- `/l/` - `/əl/` - "bottle" is `/ˈbɑtəl/`

> [!note] I've always wondered how Americans interpret the Korean "ㅡ" sound (transcribed as `/ɯ/`). It seems unaspirated, unstressed `/ə/` is the closest we get.


#### Affricated T

Affricated T `[t͡ʃ]` ("ch") is not *technically* an allophone of `/t/`, but it can sometimes be considered as one depending on context. Such as :
- `⟨t⟩` + `⟨u⟩` combination
- `⟨t⟩` + `⟨r⟩` combination
- Connected Speech (Word-Boundary Assimilation)

<center>. . .</center>

When a word contains a `⟨t⟩` followed by a `⟨u⟩` with `/j/` sound (often spelled with `⟨u⟩`, `⟨ure⟩`, or `⟨iu⟩`), `/t/` commonly becomes `[t͡ʃ]`.
- "Picture" : `/ˈpɪktjər/` -> `[ˈpɪkt͡ʃər]`
- "Natural" : `/ˈnætjərəl/` -> `[ˈnæt͡ʃrəl]`
- "Actual" : `/ˈæktjuəl/` -> `[ˈækt͡ʃuəl]`
- "Virtue" : `/ˈvɜːrtjuː/` -> `[ˈvɜːrt͡ʃuː]`
- "Fortune" : `/ˈfɔːrtjən/` -> `[ˈfɔːrt͡ʃən]`
- "Century" : `/ˈsɛntjəri/` -> `[ˈsɛnt͡ʃəri]`
- "Capture" : `/ˈkæptjər/` -> `[ˈkæpt͡ʃər] `

<center>. . .</center>

When a word contains a `⟨t⟩` followed by a `⟨r⟩`, `/t/` commonly becomes `[t͡ʃ]`.
- "True" : `/truː/` -> `[t͡ʃruː]`
- "Tree" : `/triː/` -> `[t͡ʃriː]`
- "Try" : `/traɪ/` -> `[t͡ʃraɪ]`
- "Trip" : `/trɪp/` -> `[t͡ʃrɪp]`
- "Traffic" : `/ˈtræfɪk/` -> `[ˈt͡ʃræfɪk] `

<center>. . .</center>

#todo probably should cover Assimilation before this topic.

When a word ending in `/t/` is followed by a word starting with `/j/`, the sounds blend into `[t͡ʃ]`.
- "Meet you" : `/miːt juː/` -> `[miːt͡ʃuː]`
- "Don't you" : `/doʊnt juː/` -> `[doʊnt͡ʃuː]`
- "Won't you" : `/woʊnt juː/` -> `[woʊnt͡ʃuː]`
- "Got you" : `/ɡɑːt juː/` -> `[ɡɑːt͡ʃu]`



#### Glide and Diphthongs

#definition **Glide** (Semi-Vowel or Semi-Consonant) is a sound produced with little to no friction in vocal tract, acting as a transition to or from a vowel.

The main consonant glides in English are :
- **/j/** ([voiced palatal approximant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_palatal_approximant), like the 'y' in "yes" and "you")
- **/w/** ([voiced labial-velar approximant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_labial–velar_approximant), like the 'w' in "wet" and "win")

#todo wait, isn't this labialization??

---
#definition **Diphthongs** are "gliding vowels" formed by combining two adjacent vowel sounds within a single syllable, where the tongue moves from one position to another. Common English diphthongs are :
- **/aɪ/** ("sky", "pie", "eye")
- **/aʊ/** ("house," "cow," "out")
- **/eɪ/** ("day," "rain," "ate")
- **/oʊ/** ("boat," "know," "show")
- **/ɔɪ/** ("boy," "toy," "coin")
- **/eə/** ("hair," "bear")
- **/ɪə/** ("near," "fear")
- **/ʊə/** ("tour," "cure")


### Non-Phonetic Words

#define **Non-Phonetic Words** (aka Red Words) are words that are spelled differently than how it sounds.

In GA, there are very few universal rules to predict the pronunciation of the red words; there are patterns, etymological clues, and common consonant/vowel combinations that helps. Otherwise, they must generally be memorized.

Silent letters
- initial kn : knife, knee, know, knight
- initial wr : write, wrong, wrist, wrap
- initial ps : psychology, pseudo
- -mn at the end : autumn, damn, column
- -bt at the end : doubt, debt
- -mb at the end : comb, thumb
- -gh or -ght : though, through, thought, enough, tough



Loanword and origin
- French influence (words ending in -et or -eau, or containing -ou-) : rendezvous, bouquet, ballet, echelon, faux pas
- Greek influence (words with 'ch' pronounced as /k/) : character, chaos, psychology, archipelago



Vowel diphthongs and inconsistencies
- "ou" : though, through, tough, thought
- "o" as /ʌ/ : from, love, come, does


Double consonant pairs
- accommodate, aggression, occurrence


I before e
- weird, foreign, neighbor, weigh, glacier, science


Silent e at the end
- bathe, soothe


Function words
- high-frequency, small words : the, to, was, you, one, of, where, were
