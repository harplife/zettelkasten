# International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)

## Definition and Purpose

#definition [Linguistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics) : The Scientific study of language.

#definition [Phonetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonetics) : A branch of linguistics that studies speech sounds, encompassing their production (articulatory), transmission (acoustic), and perception (auditory).

#definition [Phone](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_(phonetics)>) : (in phonetics) Any distinct speech sound.
- Phones are the [segments](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segment_(linguistics)>) of speech that possess distinct physical or perceptual properties, regardless of whether the exact sound is critical to the meanings of words.
- See also : [Phoneme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneme), [Allophone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allophone)

#definition [Phonetic Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonetic_transcription) (Phonetic Transcription) : The visual representation of phones by means of symbols.

#definition [The International Phonetic Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) (IPA) :  an alphabetic system of phonetic notation based primarily on the Latin script.

---
The IPA is designed to represent the qualities of speech that are part of lexical sounds in spoken (oral) language. Those qualities are :
- Phones
- Intonation
- The separation of syllables

The general principle of the IPA is to provide one letter for each distinctive sound (phoneme). This means that :
- It does not use combinations of letters to represent single sounds (e.g. "sh", "ea"), nor single letters to represent multiple sounds (e.g. "x").
- There are no letters that have context-dependent sound values (e.g. "c" sounding like "case" or "cease", and "g" sounding like "game" or "germ").

IPA consists of :
- 107 letters representing consonants and vowels
- 31 [diacritics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic)
- 17 additional signs to indicate suprasegmental qualities, such as length, tone, stress, and intonation

## Basic Overview

### Consonants

IPA categorizes consonants based on three primary, articulatory features :
- [Place of articulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_of_articulation) : where the constriction occurs
- [Manner of articulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manner_of_articulation) : how the airflow is restricted
- [Voicing](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_(phonetics)>) : whether the vocal cords vibrate

These features are arranged in a chart to organize consonants, primarily focusing on pulmonic airstream mechanisms, with separate categories for non-pulmonic sounds.
