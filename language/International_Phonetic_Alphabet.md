# International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)

## Definition and Purpose

#define [Linguistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics) : The Scientific study of language.

#define [Phonetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonetics) : A branch of linguistics that studies speech sounds, encompassing their production (articulatory), transmission (acoustic), and perception (auditory).

#define [Phone](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_(phonetics)>) : (in phonetics) Any distinct speech sound.
- Phones are the [segments](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segment_(linguistics)>) of speech that possess distinct physical or perceptual properties, regardless of whether the exact sound is critical to the meanings of words.

#define [Phonetic Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonetic_transcription) (Phonetic Transcription) : The visual representation of phones by means of symbols.

#define [The International Phonetic Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) (IPA) :  an alphabetic system of phonetic notation based primarily on the Latin script.

---
The IPA is designed to represent the qualities of speech that are part of lexical sounds in spoken (oral) language. Those qualities are :
- **Phones**
- **Intonation**
- **The separation of syllables**

The general principle of the IPA is to provide one letter for each distinctive sound (phoneme). This means that :
- It does not use combinations of letters to represent single sounds (e.g. "sh", "ea"), nor single letters to represent multiple sounds (e.g. "x").
- In the strictest sense, there are no letters that have context-dependent sound values (e.g. "c" sounding like "case" or "cease", and "g" sounding like "game" or "germ"). Every single speech sound has their equivalent symbol.

IPA consists of :
- 107 letters representing consonants and vowels
- 31 [diacritics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic)
- 17 additional signs to indicate suprasegmental qualities, such as length, tone, stress, and intonation

### IPA Manners and Features

![[IPA-features.svg]]


## Phonetics

#todo #define Phonetics is the branch of linguistics that studies the physical production, acoustic transmission, and perception of speech sounds.
- It examines how vocal organs create sounds (articulatory), the physical properties of sound waves (acoustic), and how listeners interpret them (auditory).
- This field uses the IPA to classify speech sounds.


### Syllable

#define A **Syllable** is a basic unit of organization within a sequence of speech sounds (e.g. a word).

The general structure of a syllable consists of two components :
- Onset
- Rhyme

> [!warning] The structure of syllable is not "defined" in any sort of way. Different languages tend to have their own structure of a syllable.
> Most languages do often share the common structure of *onset* and *rhyme* though.

The two components of a syllable is usually separated by the *first vowel*. The **Onset** describes the sound (consonant) that comes before that vowel, and the **Rhyme** describes the vowel sound and the consonant sound that follows.

> [!important] The "rhyme" of a syllable is the part used in [poetic rhymes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhyme) (rhyming).
> The rhyme (of a syllable) is often spelled "rime" to distinguish it from the poetic rhyme.

Rhyme consists of two segments, Nucleus and Coda.
- **Nucleus** is usually a single vowel, but it can be a cluster of vowels or a syllabic consonant (more on this later).
- **Coda** is a single or cluster of consonant that follows the nucleus.

> [!important] A syllable must have a nucleus, but both onset and coda are *optional*.
> It is possible to have a syllable with just the nucleus, like "a" in "able (a-ble)".

> [!warning] When there are multiple syllables in a word, it may prove challenging to distinguish between onset and coda.
> There are some rules and constraints to help :
> - The "Greedy" Onset Rule
> - Phonotactic Constraints
> 
> There are exceptions though, so we just need to find what works.

#example Putting it together, we can use a single syllable to describe the sound of the word "dog" :
- The initial consonant "d" sound is the onset
- The "aw" sound is the nucleus
- The final "g" sound is the coda

We will be using the IPA letters to describe the sound of the onset, the nucleus, and the coda.

> [!important] We don't need to deconstruct component syllables and syllable components in order to use the IPA notation & letters.
> It's just good to be aware what syllable is, so that we can distinguish the sounds in a syllable.


### Phonemes and Allophones

A single **phone** (a smallest unit of speech sound) can be either *phonemic* or *phonetic*.

A [Phoneme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneme) is any set of similar speech sounds that are *perceptually* regarded as a single basic sound, which makes words *distinguishable* from one another. In other words, a phoneme is a distinguishable smallest unit (or cluster) of sound that differentiates meaning.
- #example In American English, the words "Cat" and "Pat" are differentiated because "C" and "P" are phonemes.

An [Allophone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allophone) is any set of *perceptually indistinguishable* speech sounds used to pronounce a single phoneme.
- An allophone is said to be a **phonetic realization** of a phoneme.
- #example In American English, the "t" sounds in the words "top", "water" and "mountain" are allophones. They all share the same phoneme "t", but they all sound slightly different.

<center>. . .</center>

In IPA, we use the **phonemic** transcription (using slashes `/ /`) when we describe sound by their abstract, distinct sound using *phonemes*. We use the **phonetic** transcription (using brackets `[ ]`) when we describe the actual sounds precisely and detailed (including subtle variations like allophones).

#example Going back to the words "top", "water", and "mountain", we can transcribe them phonemically or phonetically. Like so :
- top : `/tɑp/` or `[tʰɑp]`
- water : `/ˈwɔtər/` or `[ˈwɔɾɚ]`
- mountain : `/mɑntn/` or `[ˈmãʊ̃ʔn̩]`

Note that these words have `/t/` in common, but it is pronounced in three different ways -  "t" `[tʰ]`, "d/r" `[ɾ]`, or some kind of groaning sound `[ʔ]`. More on this later.

> [!important] "Perceived Sound" is an important factor in IPA.
> We all have our own unique dialects and accents, which means not all of us will pronounce the words the same. Not only that, our unique minds perceive things differently in our own unique ways, including sounds.
> 
> While IPA is used to describe speech sound systematically and in detail, it is not a perfect measurement of speech sound. Meaning, we aren't shooting for perfect representation of speech sound, and instead, we are trying to describe the sound as we hear and perceive them as best as possible.

Additionally, the angular brackets `⟨ ⟩` are used to indicate *graphemes* or spelling of a language in written text, rather than their phonetic sounds.
- #define A [Grapheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grapheme) is the smallest functional unit of a writing system, representing a single phoneme.
- #example The spelling of the word "cat" is indicated as `⟨cat⟩`. Each individual letters are `⟨c⟩`, `⟨a⟩`, and `⟨t⟩`.


### General American English

#define **General American English** (GA or GenAM) is the umbrella accent of American English used by a majority of Americans, encompassing a continuum rather than a single unified accent. Basically, it is an accent of American English that lacks any distinctly regional, ethnic, or socioeconomic characteristics - which is used as a convenient basis for comparison.

We'll focus mainly on GA so that it keeps things simple - it will limit the amount of IPA letters we'd have to learn initially, and it will serve as a foundation for learning IPA letters meaningful for other languages.

Regardless of language, the speech sound is divided into two principal classes based on *obstruction of the vocal tract* :
- **Consonant** (obstructed sound)
- **Vowel** (unobstructed sound)

---
The majority of sounds in most languages are *pulmonic egressive sounds* - which is our main focus. From here on, when I mention consonants/vowels, I'm referring to pulmonic consonants/vowels.
- #define [Pulmonic Egressive Sounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egressive_sound#Pulmonic_egressive) : Sounds produced through the mouth (or nose) using the air stream created by the lungs, ribs, and diaphragm.

### Consonants

#define A [Consonant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consonant) is a speech sound that is articulated with complete or partial closure of the vocal tract.

IPA categorizes consonants based on three primary, articulatory features :
- [Place of articulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_of_articulation)
- [Manner of articulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manner_of_articulation)
- [Voicing](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_(phonetics)>)

---
**Voicing** refers to a classification of speech sounds that tend to be associated with vocal cord vibration but may not actually be voiced at the articulatory level. In other words, speech sounds can be described as either "voiced" or "voiceless (unvoiced)".

It's easier to understand with an example. When we make sound associated with the English letter "s", our vocal cord does not vibrate while "s" is pronounced. However, our vocal cord does vibrate when we pronounce "z".

There are other letter pairs that are voiced/voiceless, such as p/b, t/d, f/v, and more. Note that the letters in a pair are pronounced in the same way (place and manner), which we'll find out more about below.

---
**The Place of Articulation** is the approximate location in the vocal tract (e.g. lips, teeth, or palate) where the air stream is constricted/blocked to produce a consonant sound.

They are largely divided into four major parts :
- [Labial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labial_consonant) (lips)
- [Coronal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronal_consonant) (front part of the tongue)
- [Dorsal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsal_consonant) (back part of the tongue)
- [Laryngeal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngeal_consonant) (throat)

All the variations of the places of articulations are :

| Place of Articulation     | Articulators                                                                |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bilabial**              | Both lips                                                                   |
| **Labio-dental**          | Lower lip + upper teeth                                                     |
| **Linguo-labial**         | Tongue tip against upper lip                                                |
| **Dental**                | Tongue tip against upper teeth                                              |
| **Alveolar**              | Tongue tip against the superior alveolar ridge                              |
| **Post-alveolar**         | Tongue tip against back of the alveolar ridge                               |
| **Retro-flex**            | Tongue tip curled up against between the alveolar ridge and the hard palate |
| **Palatal**               | Tongue body against the hard palate                                         |
| **Velar**                 | Tongue body against the soft palate                                         |
| **Uvular**                | Tongue body against the uvula                                               |
| **Pharyngeal/epiglottal** | Tongue root against mid/upper pharynx                                       |
| **Glottal**               | Glottis                                                                     |

In the table above, I use the term "against" but it doesn't necessarily mean the articulators (organs) have to touch each other. A consonant can be produced by getting the articulators just near each other (without touching), in which case, the consonant is called an [Approximant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximant).

#todo There's an [svg version of Places of Articulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Places_of_articulation.svg), but it may need editing to include a legend for the labels.


---
**The Manner of Articulation** describes *how* speech organs (e.g. tongue, lips, teeth) constrict or modify airflow in the vocal tract to produce consonant sounds.

Key manners of articulation include :

| Manner of Articulation | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Plosive (or Stop)**      | Oral occlusive; Blocking of the oral vocal tract and no nasal air flow, causing complete air flow stop. If the consonant is voiced, the voicing is the only sound made during occlusion; if it is voiceless, a stop is completely silent. However, we do hear the effect that the onset of the occlusion has on the preceding vowel, as well as the release burst and its effect on the following vowel. |
| **Nasal**                  | Nasal occlusive; Air passes through the nose while the oral tract is blocked. Majority of nasal consonants are voiced. Not to be confused with *nasalized consonant*.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Vibrant**                | One or more brief occlusions occur; a momentary closure of the oral cavity is called a *flap/tap*, whereas several momentary closure of the oral cavity (vibrating of the articulator) is called a *trill*.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Fricative (or Spirant)** | A continuous *frication* (turbulent and noisy airflow) at the place of articulation. Types of fricative include *Sibilant* Fricatives and *Lateral* Fricatives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Affricate**              | Begins like a stop but releases into a fricative rather than having a separate release of its own.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Approximant**            | Very little obstruction. Types of approximant include *Semivowel/Glide* and *Laterals*.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |


#### Common GA Consonants

GA typically features **24 "standard" consonant phonemes**  :`/p, b, t, d, k, g, f, v, θ, ð, s, z, ʃ, ʒ, h, t͡ʃ, d͡ʒ, m, n, ŋ, l, ɹ, w, j/`

> [!important] There isn't a fixed number of phonemes because spoken language changes over time and place (e.g. regional dialects).

> [!important] English language has *more* consonant phonemes than consonant letters (of which there are 21).
> We'll first discuss the 24 standard consonant phonemes, and then also discuss *variations* of these phonemes.

> [!important] The difference between `/z/` and `/ʒ/`
> `/z/` is an alveolar sound made with the tongue near the front ridge, while `/ʒ/` is a postalveolar fricative made with the tongue further back and often with rounded lips. `/z/` sounds sharper, whereas `/ʒ/` has a softer "sh" quality.

> [!warning] Note that `/w, j/` are omitted from the list. They are considered consonants too, but they are also called "semi-vowels" due to their unique behavior.
> They will be covered in detail at [[#Semi-Vowels (j and w)]]


#### Phoneme-to-Grapheme Correspondence

In English language, a *grapheme* (a letter or a sequence of letters) may correspond to a single phoneme, or a cluster of phonemes, OR correspond to different phonemes depending on context.
- And vice versa!

#example letters that correspond to one standard phoneme :
- `⟨b⟩` to `/b/` (as in "boy")
- `⟨d⟩` to `/d/` (as in "dog")
- `⟨f⟩` to `/f/` (as in "fish")
- `⟨h⟩` to `/h/` (as in "hello")
- `⟨j⟩` to `/d͡ʒ/` (as in "joy")
- `⟨m⟩` to `/m/` (as in "money")
- `⟨p⟩` to `/p/` (as in "pop")
- `⟨r⟩` to `/ɹ/` (as in "rain")
- `⟨v⟩` to `/v/` (as in "very")
- `⟨w⟩` to `/w/` (as in "water")
- `⟨z⟩` to `/z/` (as in "zipper")

#example letters that correspond to a cluster of phonemes :
- `⟨x⟩` to `/ks/` ("box") or `/gz/` ("exist")
- `⟨q⟩` to `/kw/` (as in "quiet")

#example letters that correspond to different phonemes depending on context :
- `⟨c⟩` to `/k/` ("cat"), `/s/` ("city"), or `/ʃ/` ("official")
- `⟨g⟩` to `/g/` ("go"), `/d͡ʒ/` ("giant"), or `/ʒ/` ("garage")
- `⟨l⟩` to `/l/` ("life") or `[ɫ]` ("ball")
- `⟨n⟩` to `/n/` ("no") or `/ŋ/` ("sing" or "punk")
- `⟨s⟩` to `/s/` ("same"), `/z/` ("easy"), `/ʒ/` ("vision"), or `/ʃ/` ("pressure")
- `⟨t⟩` to `/t/` ("top") or `[ɾ]` ("better") or `[ʔ]` ("button")

> [!important] `⟨t⟩` is a bit of a special case because it is corresponding to standard phoneme `/t/` but also to non-standard phonemes `[ɾ]` and `[ʔ]`.
> Technically, these are variations of `/t/` sounds referred to as *allophones*. More about this later.

> [!important] In the *Phonology* section, we'll learn more about how context creates variance in the speech sound.


#### Digraphs

#define A [Digraph](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digraph_(orthography)>) is a pair of letters used to produce a single phoneme.
- It can also produce a cluster of phonemes (simultaneously) that does not correspond to the normal values of the two characters combined.

The English alphabet has fewer consonant *letters* than the English language has consonant *sounds*, so *digraphs* are used to extend the alphabet. The consonant digraphs include :
- `⟨ch⟩` for `/t͡ʃ/`
- `⟨sh⟩` for `/ʃ/`
- `⟨th⟩` for `/ð/` or `/θ/`
- `⟨ng⟩` for `/ŋ/`
- `⟨wh⟩` for `/h/` or `/w/`
- `⟨ph⟩` for `/f/`

> [!warning] If each letter in a pair of letters retains its own, individual sound, these are *NOT* considered a digraph.
> For example, `⟨fl⟩` in "fly" or `⟨bl⟩` in "blue" are not digraphs because they do not produce a single phoneme.


#### Affricates

#define An [Affricate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affricate) is a consonant that begins as a stop and releases as a fricative, generally with the same place of articulation. GA has two affricate phonemes :
- `/d͡ʒ/` (j)
- `/t͡ʃ/` (ch)

While tie bar (arc) symbol above or below the two consonants is not necessary, but it helps to clarify.

> [!important] While affricates are easy to spot with words like "job" or "choice" where letters clearly indicate sound, it can be difficult to spot them otherwise.
> Affricates are harder to spot in words like "true" (sounds like Chroo) or "educate" (sounds like eh-ju-cate). We'll discuss more about this once we cover **Assmilation**.

<center>. . .</center>

`/d͡ʒ/` is commonly spelled with `⟨j⟩`, `⟨g⟩`, `⟨ge⟩`, or `⟨dg⟩`. For example,
- `⟨j⟩` : job, joke, jet, major, injury
- `⟨g⟩` : giant, gentle, register, agility
- `⟨ge⟩` : page, huge, language
- `⟨dg⟩` or `⟨dge⟩` : budget, judge, bridge

<center>. . .</center>

`/t͡ʃ/` is commonly spelled with `⟨ch⟩` or `⟨tch⟩`. For example,
- `⟨ch⟩` : chain, check, rich
- `⟨tch⟩` : match, catch, kitchen


#### Sibilants

#define A [Sibilant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sibilant) is a high-intensity, high-pitched fricative or affricate consonant produced by directing airflow with the tongue against the teeth. In other words, it is a "hissing" or "hushing" sound.

In GA, the sibilant consonants are :
- (fricatives) `/s, z, ʃ, ʒ/`
- (affricates) `/d͡ʒ, t͡ʃ/`


#### Interdental Consonants

#define An [Interdental Consonant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdental_consonant) is a consonant produced by placing the tip of the tongue between the upper and lower front teeth.
- This differs from typical dental consonants, which are articulated with the tongue against the *back* of the upper incisors.

In GA, the interdental consonants are :
- (fricatives) `/ð, θ/`

> [!important] Though these sound alike, these are distinct phonemes and not allophones.
> The distinction is more clear with these minimal pairs (`/θ/` - `/ð/`) :
> - thigh - thy
> - ether - either
> - teeth - teethe (teething)
> 
> There are some general rules to distinguish them, but we'll skip on that for now.


#### Allophones

While the *phoneme* is the "ideal" version of a sound, the *allophone* is the actual physical sound produced in specific phonetic environments.

Some GA consonant standard phonemes (`/f,θ,ð,s,ʃ,ʒ,t͡ʃ,d͡ʒ,ŋ/`) does not have any allophones, but the rest of them do. We won't cover every allophones here because most of them are *indistinguishable*, but in general, the allophones can be :
- Aspirated
- Unaspirated
- Unreleased
- Devoiced (partial or fully)
- Palatalized
- Syllabic
- Dentalized

> [!important] The processes that create allophones will be explored in the *Phonology* section.

---
We'll cover specifically the allophones of `/t/`, because in American English, it is rather particular and has more allophones than other phonemes.

The allophones of `/t/` are :
- **Aspirated** "True" T `[tʰ]` : "top", "tap", "time", "talk", "train"
- **Unaspirated** T `[t]` (generally for `/st/`) : "stop", "star", "stick"
- **Flapped** T `[ɾ]` : "coating", "betting", "atom", "bottle"
- **Glottalized** T
	- **Coda** T `[ʔ]` : "apartment", "lightbulb", "right now"
	- **Nasal Released** T `[ʔn]` : "button", "mountain", "curtain", "certain"
- **Unreleased** T `[t̚]` (word final, unaspirated) : "amount", "ancient", "cat", "goat", "vent", "patient"

> [!important] Basically, `/t/` sounds differently based on where it is placed in a word.
> - **Word-initial** (aspirated or unaspirated)
> - **Word-medial** (flapped or glottalized)
> - **Word-final** (released or unreleased)

<center>. . .</center>

Some of these allophones are somewhat distinguishable from the standard `/t/` sound, which contradicts the definition of allophone. It may be more intuitive to call them *Conditioned Variants*.

#define **Conditioned Variants** are predictable variations of a single phoneme which are context-dependent; they are determined by surrounding sounds (*assimilation*), and in *complementary distribution* with each other.
- #define **Complementary Distribution** means each variant appears in specific environments (contexts) where others don't. In other words, only one variant per environment.

<center>. . .</center>

> [!important] The allophones of `/d/` are similar to the allophones of `/t/`.
> - Alveolar Flap `[ɾ]` : "buddy", "leader"
> - Nasal Release `[ʔn]` : "hidden"


#### Liquids (Rhotic and Lateral)

#define A [Liquid Consonant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_consonant) (Liquid) is a unique, vowel-like consonant produced with partial, non-obstructive closure in the mouth.
- Liquids either *modify* or *are modified by* surrounding sounds, often influencing preceding vowels.

Liquids consists of *rhotics* and *laterals* :
- #define A [Rhotic Consonant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhotic_consonant) refers to "R-like" sound.
- #define A [Lateral Consonant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_consonant) refers to "L-like" sound, where the sound is produced by blocking the flow of air along the center of the mouth with the tongue (forcing the air to escape around the tongue).

<center>. . .</center>

In GA, the only rhotic consonant is the [voiced alveolar approximant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_alveolar_approximant) `/ɹ/`, used for the the English letter `⟨r⟩`. It is typically written as `/r/` (voiced alveolar trill) for convenience, but the main difference is that the tongue does not touch the alveolar.
- `/r/` is more prominent in Spanish languages. It is called a "rolling-R".
- #define The term **Rhoticity** indicates whether an accent pronounces the `⟨r⟩`s. A rhotic accent pronounces it ("car" -> car), and non-rhotic accent doesn't ("car" -> cah).

> [!important] To be more accurate, GA IPA uses voiced post-alveolar approximant `/ɹ̠/`, but we simplify it to `/ɹ/`.

<center>. . .</center>

In GA, there are *technically* two lateral consonants :
- **Voiced alveolar lateral approximant** `/l/`, aka "Light L"
- **Velarized alveolar lateral approximant** `/ɫ/`, aka "Dark L"

The sound `/l/` is produced by placing the tip of the tongue against the alveolar ridge to block the central airflow. Generally, this sound occurs as syllable-onset (e.g. "light", "fly").

The sound `/ɫ/` is produced by *velarization* (without the tip of the tongue touching the alveolar). Generally, this sound occurs as syllable-coda (e.g. "always") or word-final (e.g. "well").
- #define [Velarization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velarization) modifies the articulation of a consonant by raising the back of the tongue toward the velum.

> [!warning] `/ɫ/` never appears as onset of a syllable.

In American English, `⟨l⟩` is typically transcribed as `/l/`, which is the standard phoneme which the letter corresponds to. In this case, `[ɫ]` is described as an allophone of `/l/`.
- Ironically, `/l/` can replace `/ɫ/` for *enunciation* (e.g. "fill", "ball").


### Vowels

#define A [Vowel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel) is a speech sound produced with an open vocal tract, allowing air to flow freely without significant restriction from the articulators.
- Vowels vary in quality, loudness, and length.
- Vowels are usually voiced.
- Vowels are closely involved in prosodic variation such as [tone](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_(linguistics)>), [intonation](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intonation_(linguistics)>) and [stress](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(linguistics)>). Note that American English tend to be monotone but stress is still very impactful.

In linguistics, vowels are studied using the *Cardinal Vowel System* and acoustic analysis of *Formants*.


#### Cardinal Vowel System

The [Cardinal Vowel System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_vowels) is a foundational auditory-based **reference framework** which describe vowels in terms of the features of tongue **height** (vertical dimension), tongue **backness** (horizontal dimension), and **roundedness** (lip articulation).
- This is meant to be used as a reference, so that vowels (not described in the system) can be described in reference to the cardinal vowels.
- This is an "idealized" system, rather than a precise physical map of the tongue.
- Although outdated, it is still commonly used in linguistics as a tool to classify vowel sounds.

The Cardinal Vowels consists of 8 primary and 10+ secondary reference points.

![[Cardinal_Vowels.svg]]
> This is a **vowel quadrilateral diagram** based on the Cardinal Vowel System. There are many variations of this diagram (also just referred to as vowel quadrilateral).

> [!warning] Note that the Cardinal Vowel System is designed as a reference framework.
> It is *NOT* a complete inventory of all human speech sounds.

In this system, three vowels have articulatory definitions :
- `/i/` (represents [Closed Front Unrounded Vowel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_front_unrounded_vowel))
- `/u/` (represents [Closed Back Rounded Vowel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_back_rounded_vowel))
- `/ɑ/` (represents [Open Back Unrounded Vowel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_back_unrounded_vowel))

These three vowels serve as the "**Corner Vowels**", by which the other vowels are described to be *auditorily equidistant* from. There are **four degrees of aperture** (height) :
- **Close** (high tongue position)
- **Close-Mid**
- **Open-Mid**
- **Open** (low tongue position)

These degrees of aperture *plus* the front-back distinction define *eight reference points* on a mixture of articulatory and auditory criteria; these eight vowels are known as the eight **Primary Cardinal Vowels**.
- Vowels like these are "claimed to be" common in the world's languages.
- We can see numbers on the diagram. The primary ones are CV 1 through 8.

Variations of the primary cardinal vowels and the ones in between are called the **Secondary Cardinal Vowels**.

#### Acoustic Analysis of Formants

Modern, scientific description of vowels are more commonly based on acoustic analysis of *formant* frequencies ($F_{1}$ and $F_{2}$).

#define A [Formant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formant) is a resonance frequency (an acoustic energy peak) of the human vocal tract that shapes speech sounds, particularly determining the quality of vowels.
- The information that humans require to distinguish between speech sounds can be represented purely quantitatively by specifying peaks in the frequency spectrum.
- Most of these formants are produced by tube and chamber resonance.
- They appear as dark, horizontal bands on a spectrogram.
- The formant with the lowest frequency is called $F_{1}$, the second $F_{2}$, and so forth.
- $F_{0}$ represents the *fundamental frequency*, which is the actual pitch of the speech sound.

> [!important] Mathematically, a formant is defined as a spectral peak in the sound spectrum of the voice, representing a resonance of the human vocal tract.
> It is best understood as the local maximum in the frequency envelope of a sound, typically corresponding to a pole in a linear predictive coding (LPC) filter model.
> 
> A formant is characterized by three main components :
> - **Center Frequency** ($F_{i}$) - The frequency of the maximum energy, where $i$ is the formant number.
> - **Bandwidth** - The width of the resonance, determining how sharply peaked the energy is.
> - **Amplitude** - The intensity of the energy at that resonance.

Multiple studies have established **the average formant frequencies for vowels**.
- Each vowel has a distinct $F_{1}$ and $F_{2}$ pattern; they are considered the most important formants as they are responsible for vowel sounds.
- Formants $F_{3}$ and up are responsible for timbre (vocal color of a voice).
- Female, male, and child speakers have different average formant frequencies, typically higher in children and females due to shorter vocal tracts.

> [!important] Formants are not affected by pitch.
> When we say "ah", the formants that make up that sound will remain the same no matter the pitch of the sound.

$F_{1}$ is a key indicator for tongue height. Higher $F_{1}$ corresponds to a lower tongue position (more open mouth).

$F_{2}$ is a key indicator for tongue backness. Higher $F_{2}$ corresponds to a more forward tongue position.

$F_{3}$ is a key indicator for lip rounding. Lower $F_{3}$ corresponds to a more tight roundedness.
- Lip rounding lowers all formants, but its effects on $F_{2}$ and $F_{3}$ is often more pronounced than on $F_{1}$.
- $F_{3}$ is also affected by other tongue and throat adjustments, such as retroflexion (r-coloring), which also lowers $F_{3}$.

![[Pasted image 20260213180719.png | center | 500]]
![[Pasted image 20260213181203.png | center | 500]]
![[Pasted image 20260213181211.png | center | 500]]

As mentioned before, each vowel has a distinct $F_{1}$ and $F_{2}$ pattern. As such, vowel is often graphically analyzed in $F_{1} : F_{2}$ vowel space.

> - The "ah" resides around 1,000 Hz (where both $F_{1}$ and $F_{2}$ is nearby)

#### Common GA Vowels

GA typically features **14-16 vowels**, (`/i, ɪ, eɪ, ɛ, æ, ɑ, ɔ, oʊ, ʊ, u, ʌ, ə, aɪ, aʊ, ɔɪ/`).

> [!important] Vowels are more versatile than consonants.
> - Vowel sounds may differ by region, and when they are, we call it *regional dialect*.
> - Vowel sounds follow trends; some vowels *merge*.
> - Vowel sounds may vary by syntax; they are either *stressed* or *reduced*.

#define A [Monophthong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monophthong) (Pure Vowel) is a single phoneme characterized by a relatively stable articulatory configuration throughout its duration.
- During the production of a monophthong, the tongue does not undergo significant vertical (height) or horizontal (front-back) movement toward a different position of articulation.

| Phoneme | Vowel Quality | Sound                    | Examples                                                                                   | Merge                   |

![[IPA_GA_Vowels.svg]]

---
From a Korean's perspective, it feels like there are some vowels "missing" in GA, such as short "oh", and 으.

<center>. . .</center>

The `/o/` "oh" sound is not used in GA (at least, not as monophthong).
- When we look at words like "go", the letter `⟨o⟩` is pronounced like "oh-ooh".
- When we look at words like "dog", the letter `⟨o⟩` is pronounced like "aw".
- When we look at words like "boy", the letter `⟨o⟩` is pronounced like "uh".

<center>. . .</center>

The `/ɯ/` "으" sound is  not at all used in GA.
- Fun fact : this sound can be made by pronouncing `/u/` without the rounding the lips.
- The closest we get is `/ə/`, especially when it is followed by `/r/` or `/l/`. However, in this case, the vowel can be omitted. See [[#Syllabic Consonants]].


#### Diphthongs

#define **Diphthongs** are "gliding vowels" formed by combining two adjacent vowel sounds within a single syllable, where the tongue moves from one position to another.

Common English diphthongs are :

| Phonemes | Sound  | Examples                                                                 | Merge                            |

| `/eə/`   | eh-uh  | h**ai**r, b**ea**r, w**ea**r, sq**uare**                                 |                                  |
| `/ɪə/`   | i-uh   | n**ea**r, f**ea**r, h**e**r**e**, b**ee**r, y**ea**r, cl**ea**r          |                                  |

Note that some vowels only appear in diphthongs, such as :
- `/e/` in `/eɪ/` or `/eə/`
- `/o/` in `/oʊ/`
- `/a/` in `/aɪ/` or `/aʊ/`

Modern GA notations sometimes (or completely) replace these vowels :
- `/ɔɪ/` is sometimes replaced with `/oɪ/`
- `/ɑ/` is completely replaced with `/a/` in `/aɪ/` and `/aʊ/`

---
Although they are less common, **triphthongs** (three vowels) exists in GA as well. It typically occur when a "true" diphthong is followed by `/əɹ/` or `/əl/`. For example,
- `/aɪəɹ/` - fire, choir, desire, tire
- `/aʊəɹ/` - hour, power, flower, sour
- `/ɔɪəɹ/` - royal, loyal, enjoyable, employer
- `/eɪəɹ/` - player, layer, prayer
- `/oʊəɹ/` - lower, mower, slower
- `/aʊəl/` - vowel, towel, bowel, dowel
- `/ɔɪəl/` - loyal, royal
- `/aɪəl/` - dial, vial, denial

Exceptions are words like :
- Hiatus - `/haɪˈeɪtəs/`
- Oasis - `/oʊˈeɪsəs/`

Whether there is any "true" triphthong in GA is something that is debated because they are almost always split by a *syllable boundary*.


### Semi-Vowels (j and w)

#define A [Semi-Vowel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semivowel) (Semi-Consonant) is a sound that is phonetically similar to a vowel sound but functions as the syllable boundary, rather than as the nucleus of a syllable.

#define A **Glide** is a sound produced with little to no friction in vocal tract, acting as a transition to or from a vowel.

A semi-vowel often acts as an onset that glides to a nucleus (a vowel).

The main semi-vowels in GA are `/j/` and `/w/`.

<center>. . .</center>

`/j/` is a [voiced palatal approximant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_palatal_approximant), called simply as "yod", which is a sound primarily produced by the letter `⟨y⟩`, but also occurs commonly in the spellings `⟨u⟩`, `⟨ew⟩`, `⟨ue⟩`, `⟨iu⟩`, `⟨io⟩`, and `⟨eo⟩`.
- It appears frequently at the start of words (e.g. "yes", "use") or after consonants (e.g. computer, music).

Anytime the letter `⟨y⟩` appears as a consonant at the beginning (onset) of a syllable, `/j/` sound modifies the following vowel, by arching up the middle of the tongue towards the hard palate.

#example words with `⟨y⟩` + vowel combination :
- you, young, beyond, yet, yes

#example vowel(s) with yod sound :
- `⟨u⟩` --> `/ju/` - cute, use, unit, human, music
- `⟨ew⟩` --> `/ju/` - view, few
- `⟨ue⟩` --> `/ju/` - queue, value

#example vowel(s) with yod sound in rapid speech :
- `⟨iu⟩` - medium
- `⟨io⟩` - union, opinion, onion
- `⟨eo⟩` - theory, video

> [!important] The letter `⟨j⟩` has a chaotic, split history, originating as a stylistic variation of `⟨I⟩` in Latin to represent the semi-vowel `/j/`.
> Its varied pronunciations result from the letter being adopted for different sounds as Romance languages developed `/dʒ/` and Germanic languages kept the original `/j/` sound. It also evolved into Spanish `/h/` sound and French `/ʒ/` sound.

<center>. . .</center>

`/w/` is a [voiced labial-velar approximant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_labial–velar_approximant), which is a sound primarily produced by the letter `⟨w⟩` followed by a vowel.
- It can also come before a vowel producing a different sound.
- It is also sometimes represented by `⟨u⟩` ad `⟨wh⟩`

#example The letter `⟨w⟩` followed by a vowel :
- `⟨wa⟩` --> `/wɔ/` or `/wɑ/` - water, wash, wander, toward, reward
	- `⟨wa⟩` --> `/wʌ/` - was, watch
	- `⟨wa⟩` --> `/weɪ/` - way, wake, wave, wale, wade, wait
- `⟨we⟩` --> `/wɪ/` - week, went, wet, between
- `⟨wi⟩` --> `/wɪ/` - with, win, wink, twin
	- `⟨wi⟩` --> `/wa/` - wife, 
- `⟨wo⟩` --> `/wʊ/` - woman, would, wolf
	- `⟨wor⟩` --> `/wɔɹ/` - work, war, word
	- `⟨woo⟩` --> `/wʊ/` - woo, wool, wood

> [!important] What does `/wʊ/` sound like?
> The production of `/wʊ/` sound starts by rounding the lips tightly and moving the tongue to the back, then gliding directly into a relaxed `/ʊ/` sound.

#example The letter `⟨w⟩` after a vowel :
- `⟨ow⟩` --> `/aʊ/` - cow, now, how
- `⟨aw⟩` --> `/ɔː/` - saw, raw, law
- `⟨ew⟩` --> `/juː/` - few, new, drew

#example The letter `⟨u⟩` after `⟨q⟩` or `⟨g⟩` :
- `⟨qu⟩` - queen `/kwin/`, quick `/kwɪk/`, quiet `/'kwaiət/`, quake `/kweɪk/`
- `⟨gu⟩` - language `/'læŋɡwɪdʒ/`, guava `/'gwɑːvə/`

#example The digraph `⟨wh⟩` pronounced as `/w/` or `/ʍ/` :
- what, whale, when, wheel, white, whip, who, whole

> [!important] The letter `⟨w⟩` is silent before `⟨r⟩` (e.g. write, wrong, wrist).


## Phonology

#define [Phonology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonology) is the branch of linguistics that studies the systematic organization and patterns of sounds within a specific language to convey meaning.
- It focuses on how phonemes and sound features function cognitively and structurally, rather than just their physical production (phonetics).


### Stress

#define [Stress](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(linguistics)>) (or Accent) is the relative emphasis or prominence given to a certain syllable in a word or to a certain word in a phrase or sentence.
- This emphasis is made by increased loudness and vowel length, full articulation of the vowel, and changes in pitch/tone.

In the IPA, stress is marked by a vertical tick placed *before* the syllable.

A stress is described as either *primary* or *secondary*.

#define A **Primary Stress** marks the loudest/most prominent syllable in the word, and denoted with a raised tick `⟨ˈ⟩`.
- #example "Tomato" -> `/təˈmeɪ.toʊ/`, the "may" sound is the loudest.

#define A [Secondary Stress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_stress) marks the weaker but still noticeably loud syllable in the word, and denoted with a lowered tick `⟨ˌ⟩`.
- #example "Information" -> `/ˌɪn.fərˈmeɪ.ʃən/`, the "in" sound is slightly emphasized.

Typically, a **syllable break** `⟨.⟩` is used to indicate the division between syllables within a word. It makes transcription easier to read (it is mostly for convenience).
- When a stress is used in a word, a syllable break helps to distinguish unstressed syllables.


#### Reduction of Unstressed Syllables

#define [Vowel Reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel_reduction) refers to any change in the acoustic quality of vowels as a result of changes in stress, sonority, duration, loudness, articulation, or position in the word, which are perceived as "weakening". It often makes the vowels shorter.

Absence of stress on a syllable, or on a word in some cases, is frequently associated with *vowel reduction*.
- Many such syllables are pronounced with a centralized vowel (e.g. schwa `/ə/`) or with certain other vowels that are described as being "reduced" (or sometimes with a syllabic consonant as the syllable nucleus).

In GA, unstressed syllables are reduced in four different ways :
- Mid/Low Vowels to `/ə/`
- High Front/Back Vowels to `/ɪ/` or `/ə/`
- R-Dissimilation (dropping the first `/r/`)
- Suffix Reduction to `/ə/`

#example Mid/Low Vowels to `/ə/` :
- "About" : `/əˈbaʊt/`
- "Sofa" : `/ˈsoʊfə/`
- "Computer" : `/kəmˈpjuːtɚ/`
- "Official" : `/əˈfɪʃəl/`

#example High Front/Back Vowels to `/ɪ/` or `/ə/`
- "Decide" : `/dɪˈsaɪd/` (often /ɪ/ or /ə/)
- "Potato" : `/pəˈteɪtoʊ/` (first 'o' reduces)

#example R-Dissimilation (dropping the first `/r/`)
- "Surprise" : `/səɹˈpɹaɪz/` --> `[səˈpɹaɪz]`
- "Library" : `/ˈlaɪbɹɛɹi/` --> `[ˈlaɪbɛɹi]`
- "Governor" : `/ˈɡʌvərnər/` --> `[ˈɡʌvənər]`
- "Caterpillar" : `/ˈkætəɹpɪlər/` --> `[ˈkætəpɪlər]`
- "Particular" : `/pərˈtɪkjələr/` --> `[pəˈtɪkjələr]`
- "Frustrated" : `/fɹʌˈstreɪtɪd/` --> `[fʌˈstreɪtɪd]`

#example Suffix Reduction to `/ə/`
- "-ate" --> `/ət/` : climate, delegate, private
- "-less" --> `/ləs/` : careless, helpless
- "-es" or "-ed" --> `/əz,əd/` : roses, wanted
- "-er" --> `/ər/` : teacher, better, driver
- "-tion" or "-sion" --> `/ʃən/` : operation, information, decision
- "-ity" --> `/əɾi/` : city, reality
- "-al" --> `/əl/` : musical
- "-ous" --> `/əs/` : famous
- "-ant" --> `/ənt/` : important


#### Key Patterns for Stress in GA

> [!important] Many languages have rhythmic stress.
> Location of the stress may not be predictable, but when the location of one stressed syllable (which may be the primary stress) is known, certain syllables before or after can be predicted to also be stressed (secondary stress).
> 
> However, it's not very predictable in English. Lol

While English is not strictly syllable-timed, stress patterns heavily influence vowel reduction, where unstressed vowels often become a schwa `/ə/` or `/ɪ/`.

Key Patterns for English Stress :
- Two-Syllable Noun vs. Verb Pairs (Initial-Stress-Derived Noun)
- Compound Nouns
- Compound Verbs
- Prefix
- Suffix
- **Secondary Stress:** Often found in long words, particularly on the first or second syllable, preceding the primary stress (e.g., _monumental_ /ˌmɑnjəˈmɛntəl/).

---
Many two-syllable words change meaning based on stress placement - nouns typically stress the first syllable, while verbs stress the second. This pattern occurs due to *initial-stress-derived noun*.

#define [Initial-Stress-Derived Noun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial-stress-derived_noun) is a phonological process in English that moves stress to the first syllable of verbs when they are used as nouns or adjectives.

| Word      | Noun IPA       | Verb IPA      | Note             |
| --------- | -------------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| Affect    | `/ˈæfɛkt/`     | `/əˈfɛkt/`    |                  |
| Attribute | `/ˈætrəˌbjut/` | `/əˈtrɪbjut/` |                  |
| Convert   | `/ˈkɑːnvɜːrt/` | `/kənˈvɜːrt/` | `/ɑː/` or `/ɔː/` |
| Conflict  | `/ˈkɑːnflɪkt/` | `/kənˈflɪkt/` | `/ɑː/` or `/ɔː/` |
| Desert    | `/ˈdɛzɚt/`     | `/dɪˈzɜːrt/`  |                  |
| Object    | `/ˈɑːbdɛkt/`   | `/əbˈdʒɛkt/`  |                  |
| Produce   | `/ˈproʊduːs/`  | `/prəˈduːs/`  |                  |
| Progress  | `/ˈprɔːɡrɛs/`  | `/prəˈɡrɛs/`  |                  |
| Project   | `/ˈprɔːdʒɛkt/` | `/prəˈdʒɛkt/` |                  |
| Record    | `/ˈrɛkərd/`    | `/rɪˈkɔrd/`   |                  |

---
#define A **Compound Noun** is a single noun composed of two or more words that function together as a single unit, often changing the original words' meanings to define a specific person, place, or thing. They can be written as one solid word, or multiple separate words (spaced or hyphenated).
- #example Compound Nouns : bedroom, ice cream, mother-in-law, newspaper

Generally, *primary stress* is placed on the *first* element of the compound noun.

---
#define A **Compound Verb** is a single verb composed of two or more words that function together as a single unit, or a single subject performing multiple actions. They can be written as one solid word, or multiple separate words (spaced or hyphenated).
- #example Compound Verbs : skydive, dry-clean, turn on

Generally, *primary stress* is placed on the *second* element of the compound verb.

---






---
Suffixes tend to cause the primary stress to move to the syllable immediately preceding them.

#example Common suffix types :
- Noun endings : "-tion", "-sion", "-ness", "-ment", "-ity"
- Adjective endings : "-ful", "-less", "-ous", "-able", "-ive"
- Verb endings : "-ate", "-en", "-ify", "-ize"

#example Stress shift caused by suffix :
- "complicate" `/ˈkɑmpləˌkeɪt/` --> "complication" `/ˌkɑmpləˈkeɪʃən/`
- "atom" `/ˈætəm/` --> "atomic" `/əˈtɑmɪk/`
- "able" `/ˈeɪbəl/` --> "ability" `/əˈbɪləti/`


### Coarticulation

#define [Coarticulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coarticulation), in its general sense, refers to a situation in which a speech sound is influenced by its neighboring sound.
- This phenomenon makes speech more fluid and faster, but often distorts individual phonemes based on their neighbors.

Coarticulation can refer to two different phenomena :
- Assimilation of the place (or manner) of articulation
- The production of a co-articulated consonant


Key types of coarticulation :
- Anticipatory (Regressive) Coarticulation
- Perseverative (Progressive) Coarticulation
- Reciprocal Coarticulation (bidirectional, feature from preceding sound and following sound affect each other)
- Coalescent Coarticulation (bidirectional, sounds from before and after merge to become new)
- Vowel Centralization (unstressed vowel laxing to uh)


Note that coalescent coarticulation is a process, which often results in Secondary Articulation (labialization or palatalization).


#### Assimilation

#define [Assimilation](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assimilation_(phonology)>) is a common phonological process where a speech sound changes to become more similar to a neighboring sound, making words easier to pronounce.
- A sound may change to match the sound before it (**progressive**/**perseverative**), after it (**regressive**/**anticipatory**), or merge with an adjacent sound into a new single sound (**coalescent**/**reciprocal**).
- Assimilation can change either the **place** or the **manner** of articulation.
- Assimilation can occur where the final sound of one word changes to become more similar to the first sound of the next word, in which case, it is called **Word Boundary Assimilation**.

---
Progressive Assimilation
- `/s/` to `/z/`
- #todo /d/ to /t/
- #todo voicing assimilation

 When `/s/` follows a *voiced* sound, `/s/` becomes voiced.
- Plural noun s to z
- Verb conjugate s to z
- Intervocalic s to z

> [!important] Note that all vowels are *voiced*.

Examples of progressive assimilation for noun plural `/s/` :
- "Dogs" - `/dɔɡz/`
- "Bags" - `/bæɡz/`
- "Trees" - `/tɹiz/`
- "Days" - 

Examples of progressive assimilation for verb conjugate `/s/` :
- "Brings"
- "Runs"
- "Loves"

Examples of progressive assimilation for intervocalic `/s/` :
- "Reason"
- "Season"
- "Easy"

> [!warning] There are exceptions like "basic", "basis", or "crisis".

> [!important] Omitting word boundary assimilation (assimilation in connected speech) is generally considered a form of clear, careful, or slow enunciation.
> - Ten bucks -> instead of "tem bucks", say ten. bucks.
> - want you -> instead of "wanchu", say want. you.
> - did you -> instead of "didju", say did. you.
> - bless you -> instead of "bleshu", say bless. you.

---
#todo Regressive Assimilation


consonant labialization is a secondary articulation where a consonant is produced with simultaneous lip rounding or protrusion.
- This is often a result of regressive assimilation, where a consonant becomes labialized due to a following rounded vowel (e.g. /u/ or /o/).


---
#todo Coalescent Assimilation








#### Co-articulated Consonants

#todo A [Co-articulated Consonant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-articulated_consonant) is a consonant produced by simultaneous (or rapidly overlapping) articulations of adjacent sounds, commonly resulting in labialization, velarization, nasalization, and palatalization.


velarization is a secondary articulation where the back of the tongue is raised toward the soft palate (the velum) while another sound is being produced.

#todo velarization
light l and dark l (already covered this)


velarization (nasal assimilation) --> n (alveolar nasal) to ŋ (velar nasal "engma") when it precedes a velar consonant such as k or g

velarization is a common phonological process in connected speech and within words (assimilation of place), where the nasal consonant adopts the articulation point of the following sound to make speech faster and smoother.

"In case" `[ɪŋ keɪs]`
"Green grass" `[ɡriŋ ɡræs]`
"Bank" `[bæŋk]`
"Uncle" `[ˈʌŋkl̩]`
"Thank" `[θæŋk]`


#### Affricated T (Assimilation)

Affricated T `[t͡ʃ]` ("ch") is not *technically* an allophone of `/t/`, but it can sometimes be considered as one depending on context - such as :
- `⟨t⟩` + `⟨u⟩` combination
- `⟨t⟩` + `⟨r⟩` combination
- Connected Speech (Word-Boundary Assimilation)

<center>. . .</center>

When a word contains a `⟨t⟩` followed by a `⟨u⟩` with `/j/` sound (often spelled with `⟨u⟩`, `⟨ure⟩`, or `⟨iu⟩`), `/t/` commonly becomes `[t͡ʃ]`.
- "Picture" : `/ˈpɪktjər/` -> `[ˈpɪkt͡ʃər]`
- "Natural" : `/ˈnætjərəl/` -> `[ˈnæt͡ʃrəl]`
- "Actual" : `/ˈæktjuəl/` -> `[ˈækt͡ʃuəl]`
- "Virtue" : `/ˈvɜːrtjuː/` -> `[ˈvɜːrt͡ʃuː]`
- "Fortune" : `/ˈfɔːrtjən/` -> `[ˈfɔːrt͡ʃən]`
- "Century" : `/ˈsɛntjəri/` -> `[ˈsɛnt͡ʃəri]`
- "Capture" : `/ˈkæptjər/` -> `[ˈkæpt͡ʃər] `

<center>. . .</center>

When a word contains a `⟨t⟩` followed by a `⟨r⟩`, `/t/` commonly becomes `[t͡ʃ]`.
- "True" : `/truː/` -> `[t͡ʃruː]`
- "Tree" : `/triː/` -> `[t͡ʃriː]`
- "Try" : `/traɪ/` -> `[t͡ʃraɪ]`
- "Trip" : `/trɪp/` -> `[t͡ʃrɪp]`
- "Traffic" : `/ˈtræfɪk/` -> `[ˈt͡ʃræfɪk] `

<center>. . .</center>

When a word ending in `/t/` is followed by a word starting with `/j/`, the sounds blend into `[t͡ʃ]`.
- "Meet you" : `/miːt juː/` -> `[miːt͡ʃuː]`
- "Don't you" : `/doʊnt juː/` -> `[doʊnt͡ʃuː]`
- "Won't you" : `/woʊnt juː/` -> `[woʊnt͡ʃuː]`
- "Got you" : `/ɡɑːt juː/` -> `[ɡɑːt͡ʃu]`


> [!important] In contexts requiring very crisp, precise, or slow speech (e.g. formal public speaking, acting, singing), avoiding the affrication of `/t/` and `/d/` is often considered more articulate.
> Otherwise, the affrication is totally normal and natural for casual and informal speech.



#### Affricated D (Assimilation)

Affricated D `/d͡ʒ/` ("j") is not technically an allophone of `/d/`, but it can sometimes be considered as one when **yod-coalescence** occurs.

In this context, `[d͡ʒ]` is a sound variation of `/d/` when it appears before `/j/` (yod) sound (typically happens with , typically in unstressed syllables. For example,
- "Educate" - `/ˈɛdjəkeɪt/` --> `/ˈɛd͡ʒəkeɪt/`
- "Soldier" - `/ˈsoʊldjər/` --> `/ˈsoʊld͡ʒər/`
- "Gradual" - `/ˈɡrædjuəl/` --> `/ˈɡræd͡ʒuəl/`

Same thing happens with a connected speech. For example,
- "Did you" - `/ˈdɪd ju/` --> `/ˈdɪd͡ʒu/`

<center>. . .</center>

In a bit of weaker case, `/d/` becomes *slightly* affricated with `⟨dr⟩` :
- e.g. drama, drum, dry



#### Yod-Coalescence

#define **Yod-Coalescence** is a form of *reciprocal assimilative palatalization* where an alveolar consonant `/t,d,s,z/` merges with a following palatal approximant `/j/` (the "yod") to produce post-alveolar sounds `/ʃ,ʒ,d͡ʒ,t͡ʃ/`.
- In GA, this is common when the vowel following the `/j/` is *unstressed*.
- It is also a form of connected speech reduction.

#example Yod-Coalescence in GA :
- `/t/` + `/j/` = `/tʃ/` --> nature, actually, virtue, won't-you
- `/d/` + `/j/` = `/dʒ/` --> educate, residual, soldier, graduate, did-you
- `/s/` + `/j/` = `/ʃ/` --> issue, assume, pressure
- `/z/` + `/j/` = `/ʒ/` --> azure, pleasure, leisure

> [!important] Yod-coalescence is more common in British English than American English.
> In GA, yod is dropped in some cases where yod-coalescence is expected. This is called **Yod-Dropping**.

---

followed by a `⟨u⟩` with `/j/` sound (often spelled with `⟨u⟩`, `⟨ure⟩`, or `⟨iu⟩`)


#### Yod-Dropping


#todo Yod Dropping after alveolar consonants
- `/j/` is dropped in stressed syllables after all alveolar and dental consonants (except `/p, b, f, h, k, m/`).
	- `/j/` is dropped after `/t,d,n,s,z,l/`
- This applies also to syllables often transcribed with the secondary stress mark `⟨ˌ⟩` (e.g. "avenue" `/ˈævəˌnu/`), but it is retained for unstressed syllables (e.g. "menu" `/ˈmɛnju/`).
- new, Tuesday, assume, duke, tune, due, suit

> [!note] This actually blows my mind. I've been saying all these words with yod all this time.

The "Long U" `/juː/` is typically represented by spellings like `⟨u⟩`, `⟨ew⟩`, `⟨eu⟩`, `⟨ue⟩`, and `⟨ui⟩`.


y+vowel(s) : ye, yea, yo, you, yu, ..

ie : soldier, audience, convenience




#### Rhotacization

#define **Rhotacization** (R-Coloring) is a form of *anticipatory assimilation* where a vowel's quality is modified by an immediately following `/ɹ/` sound in the same syllable.
- #define Rhotacization causes the vowel and the consonant `/ɹ/` to blend into a single (simultaenous), cohesive vocalic sound, known as an [R-Colored Vowel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-colored_vowel) (Rhotic Vowel).

There are four common r-colored vowels in GA :
- `[ɚ]` (short "er" sound) - teach**er**, col**or**, stand**ar**d, dinn**er**
- `[ɝ]` (long "er" sound) - b**ir**d, n**ur**se, l**ear**n
- `[ɑ˞]` ("ar" sound) - c**ar**, st**ar**t
- `[ɔ˞]` ("awr" sound) - n**or**th, f**or**ce, f**or**est

The difference between `[ɝ]` and `[ɚ]` only comes down to [[#Stress]].
- `[ɝ]` is stressed, so it is louder, longer, and/or of higher pitch. 
- `[ɚ]` is unstressed, so it is weaker, and/or shorter.
- This distinction is increasingly viewed as unnecessary, and so `[ɚ]` is often used in place of `[ɝ]` (they are interchangeable).

> [!important] Also, `/ɜ/` is not a true phoneme in GA. It really only shows up when it's r-colored.

R-colored vowel is really just used for accuracy, and so it is common to just separate the vowels (e.g. `/əɹ/` instead of `[ɝ]`).

<center>. . .</center>

Diphthongs `/eə/`, `/ɪə/`, and `/ʊə/` are often followed by `/ɹ/`.

| Phonemes | R-Colored | Examples                                     |
| -------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `/eəɹ/`  | `[eɚ]`    | h**ai**r, b**ea**r, w**ea**r, sq**uare**     |
| `/ɪəɹ/`  | `[ɪɚ]`    | n**ea**r, f**ea**r, here, beer, year, clear  |
| `/ʊəɹ/`  | `[ʊɚ]`    | t**ou**r, c**u**r**e**, p**oo**r, end**ure** |

> [!important] Seems like `/ʊə/` and `/ɪə/` are often followed by `/ɹ/` or `/l/`



#### s to z

Typically, `⟨s⟩` produces `/z/` sound when it is either between two vowels, or when it is a part of a coda (final consonant of a syllable).

#example words with `⟨s⟩` between two vowels :
- Easy `/ˈiːzi/`
- Phase `/feɪz/`
- Present `/ˈprɛznt/`
- Because `/bɪˈkɔːz/`
- Music `/ˈmjuːzɪk/`

#example `⟨s⟩` as a coda :
- Is `/ɪz/`
- Was `/wʌz/`
- Dogs `/dɔːgz/`
- Ends `/ɛndz/`
- Always `/ˈɔːlweɪz/`
- Please `/pliːz/`
- Goes `/goʊz/`
- Eyes `/aɪz/`

If the preceding consonant is voiceless (`/p,k,k,f,ʃ,t͡ʃ,θ/`), the `⟨s⟩` produces `/s/`.
- cats `/kæts/`
- ducks `/dʌks/`



### Special Consonants & Vowels




#todo Dentalization



#### Syllabic Consonants

#define A [Syllabic Consonants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllabic_consonant) is a consonant that function as the nucleus of a syllable, replacing an expected vowel (if there is one) in an unstressed (unaspirated), final syllable.

In GA, consonants such as `/n, m, r, l/` often acts as syllabic consonants.
- `/n/` : butt**on**, mount**ain**, hidd**en**
- `/m/` : rhyth**m**, pris**m**, bott**om**
- `/r/` : teach**er**, butt**er**, mot**or**
- `/l/` : bott**le**, litt**le**, fin**al**

Syllabic consonants are denoted with a small vertical line diacritic below the consonant symbol. Like so,
- `/n/` - `[n̩]`
- `/m/` - `[m̩]`
- `/r/` - `[ɹ̩]`
- `/l/` - `[l̩]`

> [!important] Precise phonetic accuracy is conveyed using diacritic. Meaning, phonetic transcription is used for syllabic consonants.
> The word "Button" could be transcribed phonemically `/ˈbʌtən/` and phonetically `[bʌtn̩]`.

In case of syllabic consonants, we can phonemically transcribe them with a preceding vowel `/ə/`.
- `/n/` - `/ən/` - "button" is `/ˈbʌtən/`
- `/m/` - `/əm/` - "rhythm" is `/ˈrɪðəm/`
- `/r/` - `/ər/` - "butter" is `/ˈbʌtər/`
- `/l/` - `/əl/` - "bottle" is `/ˈbɑtəl/`








### Linguistic Features

#### Non-Phonetic Words

#define **Non-Phonetic Words** (aka Red Words) are words that are spelled differently than how it sounds.
- See also : [Spelling-to-Sound Correspondences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_orthography#Spelling-to-sound_correspondences)

In GA, there are very few universal rules to predict the pronunciation of the red words; there are patterns, etymological clues, and common consonant/vowel combinations that helps. Otherwise, they must generally be memorized.

Silent letters
- initial kn : knife, knee, know, knight
- initial wr : write, wrong, wrist, wrap
- initial ps : psychology, pseudo
- -mn at the end : autumn, damn, column
- -bt at the end : doubt, debt
- -mb at the end : comb, thumb
- -gh or -ght : though, through, thought, enough, tough



Loanword and origin
- French influence (words ending in -et or -eau, or containing -ou-) : rendezvous, bouquet, ballet, echelon, faux pas
- Greek influence (words with 'ch' pronounced as /k/) : character, chaos, psychology, archipelago



Vowel diphthongs and inconsistencies
- "ou" : though, through, tough, thought
- "o" as /ʌ/ : from, love, come, does


Double consonant pairs
- accommodate, aggression, occurrence


I before e
- weird, foreign, neighbor, weigh, glacier, science


Silent e at the end
- bathe, soothe


Function words
- high-frequency, small words : the, to, was, you, one, of, where, were


#### Drawl

#define A [Drawl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawl) is a perceived feature of some varieties of spoken English and generally indicates slower, longer vowel sounds and diphthongs.
- This particular speech pattern exists primarily in varieties of English, such as [Southern American English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_American_English) ([Southern Accent](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_accent_(United_States)>)).
- See also : [Midland American English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midland_American_English)

The major characteristic of the Southern drawl is vowel breaking.
- #define [Vowel Breaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel_breaking) (Diphthongization) is the sound change of a monophthong into a diphthong or triphthong.
- The short front vowels `/æ/`, `/ɛ/`, and `/ɪ/` may be somewhat raised (or become an up-gliding diphthong, or both) before finally centralizing towards a schwa-like off-glide `[i̯ə]`. For example, "set" without drawl is `/sɛt/` but with drawl is `[sɛi̯ət]`.

#### Wine-Whine Merger

`⟨wh⟩` is a diagraph that is now most commonly pronounced `/w/` (the same as `⟨w⟩`), due to **Wine-Whine Merger**.
- Some dialects in southern U.S. retain the traditional pronunciation `/hw`.
- For more detailed info, check out this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronunciation_of_English_⟨wh⟩).

#example `⟨wh⟩` words affected by the wine-whine merger :
- "Whale" - `/ˈweɪl/` or `/ˈhweɪl/`
- "White" - `/ˈwaɪt/` or `/ˈhwaɪt/`
- "Which" - `/ˈwɪtʃ/` or `/ˈhwɪtʃ/`
- "When" - `/ˈwɛn/` or `/ˈhwɛn/`
- "Wheel" - `/ˈwil/` or `/ˈhwil/`
- "Whisper" - `/ˈwɪspər/` or `/ˈhwɪspər/`
- "Why" - `/ˈwaɪ/` or `/ˈhwaɪ/`
- "Whether" - `/ˈwɛðər/` or `/ˈhwɛðər/`
- "Whine" - `/ˈwaɪn/` or `/ˈhwaɪn/`
- "Whip" - `/ˈwɪp/` or `/ˈhwɪp/`

#example `⟨wh⟩` words unaffected by the wine-whine merger :
- "Who" - `/hu/`
- "Whom" - `/hum/`
- "Whose" - `/huz/`
- "Whole" - `/hoʊl/`
- "Whoop" - `/hup/`
