# Permanent Notes
In [[what_is_zettelkasten|Zettelkasten]], a permanent note refers to a note that has fully taken place in the WEB OF KNOWLEDGE.

It is a "state-of-being", rather than a structure or purpose.

It's the opposite of [[zettlekasten_fleeting_notes|Fleeting Notes]], where a fleeting note may be deleted, a permanent note may not.

I, personally, prefer to keep permanent notes to [[what_is_obsidian|Obsidian]].
