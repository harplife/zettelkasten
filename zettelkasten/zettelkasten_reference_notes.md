# Reference Notes
In [[what_is_zettelkasten|Zettelkasten]], reference notes are basically "COPY & PASTE" note. It's purpose is to purely write an excerpt from an external content for later viewing, i.e. to reference.

If I were to re-write the excerpt, or to express my ideas/opinions based on it, it'd then become a [[zettelkasten_literature_notes|Literature Note]], thereby making it also a [[zettelkasten_permanent_notes|Permanent Note]].

It's not that important to make a distiction between notes though.

Reference Notes and [[zettlekasten_fleeting_notes|Fleeting Notes]] are alike in the sense that it should be quick and easy to write it down - which makes Google Keep the likely tool for writing these notes.
