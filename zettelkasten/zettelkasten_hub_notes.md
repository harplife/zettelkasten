# Hub Notes
In [[what_is_zettelkasten|Zettelkasten]], a hub note contains a list of other notes that are grouped by a theme or their defining feature(s).

## My Interpretation
To me, there are three versions of a hub note:
- Central Node
- Overview
- Guide

### Central Node
This is where notes converge on a common theme.

A central node may be the start of other notes; A central node is the lowest level concept that is traced back to that are common in between notes. It's the Least Common Denominator #todo .

For example, I could make a note called "Fall (Season)". It's sole purpose would be to keep track of all things (of next level) related to Fall, like fruits that come out during Fall, Fashions for Fall, places to visit for Fall, evens that occur only at Fall, etc.

### Overview
I call it the #what-is note. It's like a book, where it covers a topic over a series of chapters. It's like a chapter, where it covers a sub-topic over a series of sections. And so on.

Basically, an Overview Note's defining feature is to cover a topic, it must:
1. define what the topic is (e.g. [[computer_science|Computer Science]])
2. list the related sub-topics (with backlinks)
3. include references to verify source

### Guide
I call it the #how-to note. It's the introduction guide. It's the getting started guide. It's the tutorial guide. It's the beginner's guide. It's pretty much any kind of guide.

It must:
1. define what the goal is (e.g. [[how_to_obsidian|How to use Obsidian]])
2. list the sections of the guide
3. include references to verify source
