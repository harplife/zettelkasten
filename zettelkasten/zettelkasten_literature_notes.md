# Literature Notes
In [[what_is_zettelkasten|Zettelkasten]], literature notes are more extensive version of [[zettelkasten_reference_notes|Reference Notes]]. It's my ideas, thoughts, opinions in regards to an article.

Once again, it's not that important to make a distinction.
In fact, a literature note may include an exerpt, or may backlink to the reference note containing it.
