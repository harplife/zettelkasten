# Fleeting Notes
In [[what_is_zettelkasten|Zettelkasten]], fleeting notes are "notes-on-the-go".
The point of fleeting notes is to write a note right there and then - without worrying about structure and detail.
Fleeting Notes may be temporary, like "a conference tomorrow",
or it may become permanent, like "details of conference".

Personally, I treat it as a placeholder, or a pin.
I put a "pin" on an idea, so that I can work on it later.
I find an article I like, but I haven't enough time to write notes about it.
Then, I write a note with at least a title and a link.

## Google Keep
I feel that [[what_is_obsidian|Obsidian]] sort of lacks, when it comes to fleeting notes.
For reasons,
- availability: there isn't a web/cloud version I can use. (I think it may be "premium")
- accessbility: in order to write a note, I have to 1) decide which folder to place it in, 2) decide filename, 3) decide alias, 4) decide title, 5) define sections, and etc. These are too many steps, just to copy and paste a link and write "read for later".
- search: sometimes I need to make sure I'm not making duplicate notes. It's rather difficult to check for those on Obsidian.
- order: Obsidian navigation panel is a tree-like structure. I need a list-like structure where notes are sorted by Most Recent.
- interface: Obsidian only allows 1 note per panel. I prefer a broader, grid view of notes where I can see multiple notes at a time and pick a note to edit with just a click (followed with a popup)

For the same reasons above, [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com/) is nearly perfect for writing fleeting notes (but it's not for any other notes).

The only downside, is there are maximum limit for number of tags.
