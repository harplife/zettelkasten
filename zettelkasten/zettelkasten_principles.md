# The 12 principles of Zettelkasten
This is not an official list provided by [[niklas_luhmann|Niklas Luhmann]] himself. But rather, it is a list of principles that summarizes [[what_is_zettelkasten|Zettelkasten]] really nicely.

It's too much of a pain to break down the list into individual notes, so we're skipping the very fisrt step. lol

1. Atomicity: a note should include a single thought/idea and not more. This allows notes to be connected, thereby creating the web of knowledge.
2. Connectivity: a note should be able to connected to one or more notes through tagging or backlicking.
3. Persistence: a note should always be connected to a note. A note that is not connected to any note is easily forgotten.
4. Reasonability: a connection between two notes should be explained - it should be reasonable so that it is easy to recognize why the notes are connected.
5. Ownership: avoid copy and paste. Always write down notes with your words, and write it down yourself.
6. Responsibility: always leave a source for any information. Adding date for when the information was retrieved may also help to perceive whether this information has gone stale.
7. Habitualization: always write down a thought or an idea into a note. Make a note taking tool easily accessible.
8. Flexibility: do not worry about structure. Notes do not have hierarchy. A note do not have to belong to a category or a folder.
9. Intermediation: some notes may not directly relate to each other. A note can come in between to connect these ideas. (For example, a note about similarities between magic and computer science)
10. Centrality: some ideas revolve around a central idea. Likewise, make a note that connects several notes together. (in this case, I use what-is note)
11. Accumulation: do not delete any note, even if the information has gone stale, or proved to be false. Instead, make a new note describing the reason why the old note has gone bad.
12. Resolution: do not be afraid to take notes. A note doesn't require it to be long, or detailed. A short, concise note may be more than enough.
