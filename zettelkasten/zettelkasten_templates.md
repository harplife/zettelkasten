# Templates for Zettelkasten
Zettelkasten is, by any means, ___FLEXIBLE___.
Meaning, there is no set template.
However, it should be structured in a way where it abides by the Principles of Zettelkasten - while ensuring that note taking is easy for myself.

## Mein template
1. Metadata at top, with aliases(list), tags(list), status(string), and edited(string)
2. Aliases should be like a title, with properly used Capital letters.
3. Tags should be all lower-cased letters.
4. Status should either be `complete` or `ongoing`
5. Edited should be in `yyyy-mm-dd` format.
6. Main title `#h1` should be right below Metadata.
7. Always use Aliases for backlinks.
8. __what-is__ note should always include all backlinks to other notes related to the topic. (e.g. [[what_is_zettelkasten|What is Zettelkasten?]])
9. refer to [[how_to_todo|How to maintain TODO list]]
10. References should be at the bottom of the note, and should aptly be named _references_.
