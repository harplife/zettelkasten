# How to Zettelkasten?
1. Follow [[zettelkasten_principles|The Principles of Zettelkasten]]
2. Use the right tools. Refer to [[zettelkasten_apps]]
3. Take notes!

## My way or highway
I think the process of Zettelkasten method is open to interpretation.

The [Getting Started](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview) goes pretty deep into it, but I'd rather keep it simple to a point where I have to remember only a few things when I make a note.

1. Make a folder, but only for convenience sake. It makes it easier to find a note I was working on.
2. Make a note following the [[zettelkasten_templates|Zettelkasten Templates]].
3. Try to put only 1 thought/idea/information.
4. Do not leave a note unconnected unless completely necessary (like readme, and todo notes).
5. Some ideas come as a bundle. Use what-is/how-to notes liberally.
