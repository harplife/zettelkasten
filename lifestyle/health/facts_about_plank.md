# Facts about Plank
According to [Eric L'Italien](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-l-italien-91a60528/), a physical therapist from Spaulding Rehab Center (Harvard-affiliated),
1. Sit-up only targets a portion of the core masculature, and the bending forward motion can strain the neck and lower back. _By comparison_, the plank pose activates all the core muscles at once, and doesn't require extra movements that can cause stress or injury.
2. Focus on doing multiple sets of smaller amounts of time (10~30 seconds).
3. Two minutes is often considered the maximum, and there isn't much more benefit after that.
