# I note, therefore I am
While working on [[what_is_zettelkasten|Zettelkasten]], I've noticed that some notes are difficult to connect to others - it ends up floating by itself.

I've thought about this issue for a bit, considered just leaving it as is (since not all notes SHOULD connect to each other), but in the end I've come to the conclusion that the center of all thoughts, ideas, and knowledges is me.

Therefore, all notes should be described or connected in such a way that it can be traced back to me.

As for how, we can work on that. #todo
