# Prepare outfits for Fall
As much as I love fall for its cool weather, the drastic changes in temperature is hard to deal with.
This problem is worse in Korea, because Train/Subways and buildings stops air conditioning, which makes it hot and stuffy inside.

I need an outfit that is focused on layers.

It'd be best if I could wear a shirt, a thin sweater/fleece, and maybe a jacket on top.
I want to wear it to work, so it needs to be business casual.

## Checklist
- [ ] Buy pants for cold weather
- [ ] Buy fleece/jacket for mild cold weather
- [ ] Buy shirts for mild cold weather
