# TODO Log
This is a top level note where it keeps track of TODO notes by time in a checklist format.
To reduce the cost of management, goal driven TODO notes are optional.
The main function of this note is to keep track of daily/weekly tasks.
Use of backlinks is recommended for tasks that require further explanation.
