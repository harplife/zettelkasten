# Get an IT Certification
This is a goal that has always been on my mind. Now this is an extension to the goal, [[goal_bachelor_in_cs|Get a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science]].

## Objective
Study and test to get one of the certifications listed in "Approved certifications from KNOU CS" #todo

## Deadline
The end of summer in 2022.
Since there aren't classes during winter or summer, I have two time slots to achieve this goal.

1. (2022) From January to the end of February.
2. (2022) From June to the end of August.

## Motivation
- I need it to replace having to write a research paper (to graduate from KNOU CS)
- It adds a line to Resume, which therefore helps with career
- Learning is good!
- A certification may prove to be more useful than a degree from a school nobody has heard of (in USA)

## Plan
For now, I'm shooting for the easier and cheaper option, [[national_certification|National Certification]].

One of the following will do:
- [ ] [[goal_get_sqld|Get SQLD Certification]]
- [ ] Get a ADsP #todo
- [ ] Get a Linux Master #todo
- [ ] Get a 정보처리기사 #todo

## Concern
- I might have to use one of the time slots to study for a class in Prime College
- I might have to use one of the time slots to make up for a class (if I get a bad grade)
- Test dates may not align very well with the time slots
