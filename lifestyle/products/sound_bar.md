# Sound Bar
I've been thinking of getting a Sound Bar for my TV.
I need to check
1. AUX cable input
2. [TOSLINK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOSLINK) input
3. Power (definitely not battery, or USB)
4. Portability/Modular Parts - I'd prefer a type that can be separated into two speakers.
5. Stand
6. Frequency Response
7. Remote
8. Buttons and Dials
9. Price
10. Color
11. No Woofer (we live in a civilized neighborhood)
12. (Optional) Bluetooth pairing with a headset
