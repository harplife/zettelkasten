# General Todos
Any Todo that can't be done over a single day (meaning it isn't a Daily Todo) belongs here. 

I've noticed a problem with Daily Todos where Todos become forgotten because they are not done. I've tried to just carry over the Todos from the day before to the current day, but it soon became chaotic with a huge pile of unfinished Todos.

It would be nice to have a plugin that takes care of this problem by having a Todo tracker that reminds me of old Todos (and possibly duplicate Todos).

But for now, non-priority Todos are to be stored and organized here.


## Work
- [ ] Integrate `cf_vectorize()` into AICRM Master Branch / GS Cert Branch
- [ ] `rfm_convert()` at AICRM returns outliers with RFM data. Remove `out_rfm_table` section.
- [ ] Upload and run GS Test Version Docker Container on 232 Server
- [ ] AICRM UBCF should take into account similarity, such that if a similar user bought a product, then the frequency of the product 1 - similarity distance. This way, a user with the highest similarity has highest weight on recommendation, and a user with the lowest (like 1) has 0 weight. Apply this maybe after GS test
- [ ] Organize note on sentimental Analysis
    - [x] BOW + Naive Bayes
    - [ ] TFIDF + Naive Bayes
    - [ ] Others
- [ ] Write a note on the Customer Population Map (Plotly)
- [ ] Write a note on [[japanese_regex|Japanese Regex]]
- [ ] Write a note on [Unicode spaces](https://jkorpela.fi/chars/spaces.html)
- [ ] [This](https://stackoverflow.com/a/37318066/10570582) might help with building a portable crawler (so that I can just pass it over to somebody)
