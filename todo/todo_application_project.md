# TODO Application Project

## Goal
The goal is to make an application that can help manage TODOs.

The focus will be on Task, Relationship, and Management.

## Task
A **TODO** is a task that needs to be completed, therefore it is a task that needs to be tracked and reminded as necessary.

I will be using the term **TASK** synonymously.

### Types
There are two types of TODOs.
1. Repeating
2. Non-Repeating

A Repeating TODO is a task that needs to be completed repeatedly, at every day, week, or any designated span of time.

A Non-Repeating TODO is a task that needs to be completed only once.

### Metadata
A task includes (but not limited to) the following information:
1. Subject
2. Description
3. Estimated Start/End Date
4. Actual Start/End Date
5. CRUD Date

Additional information for Management:
1. Show on Daily (True/False)
2. Shared to Other Users (True/False)

Added complexity for repeat:
1. Repeat Type (every n day)

Additional information for Sharing:
1. Created By
2. Edited By
3. Tasked To
4. Deleted By

## Relationship
A **Relationship** describes the hierarchy of a task to another.

The relationship can be extended to File-Task, Note-Task, and etc.

## Management
A **Management** consists of
1. CRUD of tasks and relations
