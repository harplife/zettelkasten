# Homeomorphism

## Definition
- [Homeomorphism - Topology - Mathematics | wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphism) : a [bijective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijection) and [continuous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function) function between [topological spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space) that has a continuous inverse function.
	- Homeomorphisms are the isomorphisms in the category of topological spaces.
		- Meaning, they are the mappings that preserve all the topological properties of a given space.

## Coffee Cup Donut
- There's a [mathematical joke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_joke) that says "a topologist cannot tell the difference between a coffee up and a donut".
