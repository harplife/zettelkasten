# Conjugate Variables

## Definition
- [Conjugate Variables - Mathematics | wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_variables) : pairs of variables defined in such a way that they become [[fourier_transform|Fourier Transform]] Duals, or more generally are related through [[pontryagin_duality|Pontryagin Duality]].

## Information
- Conjugate variables are part of a symplectic basis, and the uncertainty relation corresponds to the symplectic form.

## Examples
- **Time and Frequency** : the longer a musical note is sustained, the more precisely we know its frequency, but it spans a longer duration and is thus a more-distributed event or 'instant' in time. Conversely, a very short musical note becomes just a click, and so is more temporally-localized, but one can't determine its frequency very accurately.
- **Doppler and Range** : the more we know about how far away a radar target is, the less we can know about the exact velocity of approach or retreat, and vice versa. In this case, the two dimensional function of doppler and range is known as a radar ambiguity function or radar ambiguity diagram.
- **Surface Energy**
- **Elastic Stretching**

### Derivatives of Action
In classical physics, the derivatives of [action](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_(physics)>) are conjugate variables to the quantity with respect to which one is differentiating. In quantum mechanics, these same pairs of variables are related by the [[uncertainty_principle|Uncertainty Principle]].

#### Energy
- The energy of a particle at a certain event is the negative of the derivative of the action along a trajectory of that particle ending at that event with respect to the time of the event.

#### Linear Momentum
- The linear momentum of a particle is the derivative of its action with respect to its position.

#### Angular Momentum
- The angular momentum of a particle is the derivative of its action with respect to its orientation (angular position).

#### Mass-Moment
- The mass-moment ($N = t p − E r {\displaystyle \mathbf {N} =t\mathbf {p} -E\mathbf {r} }$) of a particle is the negative of the derivative of its action with respect to its rapidity.

#### Electric Potential
- The electric potential (φ, voltage) at an event is the negative of the derivative of the action of the electromagnetic field with respect to the density of (free) electric charge at that event.

#### Magnetic Potential
- The magnetic potential (A) at an event is the derivative of the action of the electromagnetic field with respect to the density of (free) electric current at that event.

#### Electric Field
- The electric field (E) at an event is the derivative of the action of the electromagnetic field with respect to the electric polarization density at that event.

#### Magnetic Induction
- The magnetic induction (B) at an event is the derivative of the action of the electromagnetic field with respect to the magnetization at that event.

#### Gravitational Potential
- The Newtonian gravitational potential at an event is the negative of the derivative of the action of the Newtonian gravitation field with respect to the mass density at that event.
