# Approximation Theory

## Definition
- [Approximation Theory - Mathematics | wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximation_theory) : A mathematical theory that is concerned with how functions can best be approximated with simpler functions, and with quantitatively characterizing the errors introduced thereby.

## Information
- The objective is to make the approximation as close as possible to the actual function, typically with an accuracy close to that of the underlying computer's floating point arithmetic.
	- This is accomplished by using a polynomial of high degree, and/or narrowing the domain over which the polynomial has to approximate the function.
		- Narrowing the domain can often be done through the use of various addition or scaling formulas for the function being approximated.
- A closely related topic is the approximation of functions by generalized Fourier series, that is, the approximations based upon summation of a series of terms based upon orthogonal polynomials.
	- Fourier transform
