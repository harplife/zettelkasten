# Pontryagin Duality

## Definition
- [Pontryagin Duality - Mathematics | wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontryagin_duality) : a duality between locally compact abelian groups that allows generalizing [[fourier_transform|Fourier Transform]] to all such groups, which include the circle group (the multiplicative group of complex numbers of modulous one), the finite abelian groups (with the discrete topology), and the additive group of the integers (also with the discrete topology), the real numbers, and every finite dimensional vector space over the reals or a $p$-adic field.
