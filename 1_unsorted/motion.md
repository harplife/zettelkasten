# Motion

## Definition
- Motion - Physics | wiki : the phenomenon in which an object changes its position with respect to time.
	- Motion is mathematically described in terms of
		- displacement
		- distance
		- velocity
		- acceleration
		- speed
		- a frame of reference (to an observer) and the measurement of the change in the position of an object (being observed) relative to that frame with the change in time

## Information
- 
	- 
- If an object is not changing relative to a given frame of reference, the object is said to be *at rest*, *motionless*, *immobile*, *stationary*, or to have a constant or time-invariant position with reference to its surroundings.
	- Modern physics holds that, as there is no absolute frame of reference, Newton's concept of [absolute motion (space and time)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_space_and_time) cannot be determined. As such, everything in the universe can be considered to be in motion.
- Motion applies to various physical systems :
	- matter (objects, bodies), matter particles, matter fields
	- radiation, radiation particles, radiation fields
	- [[curvature]]
	- space-time
