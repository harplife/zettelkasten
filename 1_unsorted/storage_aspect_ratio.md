# Storage Aspect Ratio
- **Storage Aspect Ratio (SAR)** | **Display Resolution** | **Display Modes** of a display device is the horizontal to vertical ratio of (the number of) distinct pixels in each direction.
- It can be an ambiguous term especially as the displayed resolution is controlled by different factors in [cathode ray tube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode_ray_tube "Cathode ray tube") (CRT) displays, [flat-panel displays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat-panel_display "Flat-panel display") (including [liquid-crystal displays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display "Liquid-crystal display")) and projection displays using fixed picture-element (pixel) arrays.
