# Pixel Aspect Ratio

## Definition
- **Pixel Aspect Ratio (PAR)** is a mathematical ratio that describes how the width of a [pixel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel) in a [digital image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_image) compares to the height of that pixel.
- Most [digital imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_imaging "Digital imaging") systems display an image as a grid of tiny, square pixels. However, some imaging systems, especially those that must be compatible with [standard-definition television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard-definition_television "Standard-definition television") motion pictures, display an image as a grid of rectangular pixels, in which the pixel width and height are different. Pixel aspect ratio describes this difference.
- Use of pixel aspect ratio mostly involves pictures pertaining to standard-definition television and some other exceptional cases. Most other imaging systems, including those that comply with [SMPTE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMPTE "SMPTE") standards and practices, use square pixels.
