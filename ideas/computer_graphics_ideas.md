# Ideas for Computer Graphics

## 3D Graphics Art w/ Maya
1. Use Maya to replicate M.C.Escher's [Hand with Reflecting Sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_with_Reflecting_Sphere).

## 3D Graphics Programming
1. Use [Non-photorealistic rendering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-photorealistic_rendering) to replicate "Living Paintings" from [_What Dreams May come_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Dreams_May_Come_(film))
2. Use NPR to replicate [Paul Haeberli's _Paint By Numbers (SIGGRAPH 1990)_](https://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/cs248-99/haeberli/).
