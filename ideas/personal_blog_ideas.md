## Design Ideas

### Logo

### Avatar

### Colors
Using just 1 color looks pretty cool, especially if no other color (other than gray and black) is used.

For instance, Naver Line Blog uses Green (like the logo) for mainly links (and graphs). Notable thing about it is that the highlight color is Black. So it's a nice mixture of white, gray, black, and green.

Google Developer Blog and Documentation uses Blue for small headers, menus, buttons and links. Google's other colors are used mainly for logos.

Considerations:
- Headers
- Paragraphs
- Links
- Italics
- Bold
- Highlights
- Block Quotes
- Background
- Buttons
- Menu

#### Dark Mode
I prefer Dark Mode, but I'm not a big fan of high contrast. In fact, I don't want to use pure black color - I want to use Gray.

#### Gradient

Gradient can be used anywhere, from logos to text.
Using gradient on text might be overkill (and tacky), but I would probably use gradient on banners or logos.

### Fonts
Considerations:
- Headers
- Paragraphs
- Links
- Italics
- Bold
- Highlights
- Block Quotes
- Code Block
- Language Specific
- \# Tag

### Theme References
- Discord

## Gimmicks
[Mimi's Blog](https://zhangshuqiao.org/) has interesting features:
1. [Live2D Widget](https://github.com/stevenjoezhang/live2d-widget) that displays a 2D Character that "looks" at where the mouse goes.
2. Mouse over font animation?
3. Mouse click "confetti"

### Live2D Widget

I definitely want the cat named __Hijiki__ on my blog.

This [post](https://aciddust.github.io/blog/post/Hexo-%EB%B8%94%EB%A1%9C%EA%B7%B8%EC%97%90-Live2D-%ED%94%8C%EB%9F%AC%EA%B7%B8%EC%9D%B8-%EC%A0%81%EC%9A%A9%ED%95%98%EA%B8%B0/) has a guide on how to implement the Live2D Widget, but it's in Korean and it seems to use something called _Hexo Helper_. I should probably make my own note.

### Mouse Over Font Animation
#todo I have no idea how it's done. I should research.

### Mouse Click Confetti
#todo I have no idea how it's done. I should research.
