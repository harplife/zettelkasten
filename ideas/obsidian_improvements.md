# Ideads to improve Obsidian

If I were to improve [[what_is_obsidian|Obsidian]], which functions should I add or fix?

1. More metadata support! I want to see status, and last edited date (on preview)
2. Graph view for tags. See which tags are related to each other.
3. A git plugin to see which files are yet to be added, commited, and pushed. A push command will be nice, but I feel like that's maybe going too far.
4. Connect with cloud storage, like Google Drive.
5. Web version of Obsidian? I should check if this is provided in the premium version. #todo
6. Calendar pane to manage events would be nice. In fact, a time series graph of sorts may be useful.
