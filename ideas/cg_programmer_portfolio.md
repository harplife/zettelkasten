# Ideas for CG Programer Portfolio
What would make a good example of
- understanding of animation
- ability to program
- applied mathematics

## Behavior of Moving Bodies in Space
Things move in unexpected ways in space.
For example, spinning a T-shaped item, such as a wing nut, would result in it spinning in one axis but sometimes flipping on another axis.
This [video](https://youtu.be/1VPfZ_XzisU) by Veritasium explains the science of it.

Normal engine wouldn't be able to replicate this (at least, I don't think).
So if I were to modify, or make a plugin for it, that would be a great examle of programming and mathematics.

### Deformed Glass
Like looking through a magnifying glass, objects through a glass can be affected by the deformations in the glass. Imagine funny mirrors at amusement parks.

This deformed glass effect would be perfect to emulate a deformation in space.
Meaning, an "invisible" object going through space that bends light, like a chameleon.
Being able to make an effect like this, with ray tracing and all, would be a great example of programming and mathematics.
