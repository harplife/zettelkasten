## Introduction to C/C++
### Before C++, there was C
- The C language was developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Telephone laboratories, primarily as a systems programming language (a language to write operating systems with).
- C ended up being so efficient and flexible that in 1973, Ritchie and Ken Thompson rewrote most of the Unix operating systems using C (as opposed to Assembly).
	- Unlike Assembly, which produces programs that can only run on specific CPUs, C has excellent portability, allowing Unix to be easily recompiled on many different types of computers.
	- C and Unix had their fortunes tied together.
- In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie published a book called "The C Programming Language".
	- This book was commonly known as K&R.
	- This book provided an informal specification for the language and became a de facto standard.
- In 1983, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) formed a committee to establish a formal standard for C.
	- In 1989, the C89 standard was released. It's more commonly known as ANSI C.
	- In 1990, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) adopted ANSI C. This became known as C90.
- In 1999, the ISO committee released a new version of C called C99.
	- C99 adopted many features which had already made their way into compilers as extensions, or had been implemented in C++.
