# National Certification
[[certification|Certification]] that is approved by the government.

I need to double check, but this concept may be specific to South Korea.

## South Korea
Referred to as 국가공인자격증, these certificates are approved by the South Korean government.
Meaning, government projects look for companies who have employees that hold this sort of certification.

In other words, government has a standard on who gets to work on their projects.

National Certification generally helps people's career, since companies look for people who have them, and it can be used to negotiate salary.
