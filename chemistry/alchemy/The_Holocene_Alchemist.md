### ideas for designing alchemic symbols

Creating cool, custom chemical element symbols can involve combining modern design with historical, artistic, or thematic elements. Unique approaches include designing alchemical-style glyphs, creating visual mnemonic icons, using artistic color-coding, or developing thematic, illustrated symbols based on an element's properties, such as its name origin or uses.

Here are several cool ways to make symbols for chemical elements:
- **Modernized Alchemical Symbols**: Redesign the ancient alchemical symbols (like those for gold, silver, or mercury) using modern, minimalist vector design. This combines history with modern, sleek aesthetics.
- **Thematic Letterforms**: Instead of simple block letters, style the one- or two-letter symbol (like H, O, Au, Na) to reflect the element. For example, make 'Hg' (Mercury) look liquid and silvery, or 'Fe' (Iron) look forged and metallic.
- **Visual Mnemonic Icons**: Create a small, iconic image inside or beside the letter symbol that represents the element’s primary use or defining characteristic. For example, a small glowing bulb inside 'W' for Tungsten or a tiny spark for 'P' (Phosphorus).
- **Color-Coded Property Palette**: Assign colors based on properties—e.g., fiery red for highly reactive metals, deep blue for noble gases, and muted earth tones for non-metals—to turn the symbol itself into a quick reference guide.
- **Language-Origin Illustrations**: Incorporate the Latin or Greek roots of the element into the design, such as using a Roman-style font for 'Na' (from _natrium_) or 'Au' (from _aurum_) to evoke the ancient origins of the element names.
- **Element Spelling Art**: Create "element words" by picking elements whose symbols spell out a word (e.g., BaNaNa, BeArS) and designing the letters using the visual styling of their respective, unique periodic table square.

## Alchemic Lattice Structures

[Crystal Structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_structure) is a description of the ordered arrangement of atoms, ions, or molecules in a [crystalline material](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal).
- The study of crystals and crystal formation is known as [Crystallography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystallography).


### Crystal Optics

The crystal structure (and symmetry) play a critical role in determining many physical properties, including [Optical Transparency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_and_translucency).
- [Crystal Optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_optics) is the branch of optics that describes the behavior of light in anisotropic media (e.g. crystals) in which light behaves differently depending on which direction the light is [propagating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_properties).
	- See also ([Optical Properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_properties)) : [Refraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction), [Reflectance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflectance), [Scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering), [Dispersion](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispersion_(optics)>), [Diffuse Reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuse_reflection), [Specular Reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specular_reflection), [Total Internal Reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_internal_reflection), [Photoelasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelasticity)
	- See also : [Material Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materials_science)


Metals are usually reflective because the ions are tightly bonded and electrons are free to move around; the free electrons bounce off the photons.
- The strength of an ionic bond is determined by the magnitude of the charges on the ions and the distance between their nuclei (ionic radius); stronger bonds have higher charges and smaller radii, leading to greater electrostatic attraction and higher lattice energy.

Metals (compound) can become transparent 


Single [Calcite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcite) crystals display an optical property called [birefringence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birefringence) (double refraction).

- Also called Optical [Anisotropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anisotropy) (opp. [Isotropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotropy)).


#### Summary

The lattice structure of an element—its ordered, repeating 3D atomic arrangement—profoundly dictates how it interacts with light, influencing everything from transparency and color to refractive index and light-splitting behaviors. The symmetry, spacing, and bonding within the lattice determine the electronic and phononic states available for light interaction.

Here are the primary ways the lattice structure affects optical properties:

1. Birefringence and Anisotropy
	- Direction-Dependent Light Speed: Crystals with low-symmetry lattices (e.g., trigonal, hexagonal, monoclinic, like calcite or quartz) exhibit birefringence. This means the refractive index differs depending on the direction of light travel through the crystal.
	- Double Refraction: Due to this anisotropy, these lattices split a single ray of light into two distinct rays (an ordinary ray and an extraordinary ray) traveling at different speeds.
	- Polarization Control: Birefringent structures are used to control the polarization of light, essential for optical components like waveplates, polarizers, and LCD screens.

2. Electronic Band Structure and Absorption
	- Band Gap Regulation: The lattice spacing and symmetry determine the energy gap between the valence and conduction bands. This dictates which wavelengths of light are absorbed (e.g., in the UV range) and which are transmitted, defining the material's color or transparency.
	- Strain-Induced Tuning: Applying strain to a lattice (compressive or tensile) can alter the band gap, shifting the absorption spectrum across a wide range of wavelengths.
	- Direct vs. Indirect Bandgap: The lattice symmetry dictates whether the semiconductor has a direct bandgap (efficient light emission) or indirect (inefficient), as seen in different phases of Si or GaN.

3. Optical Activity (Polarization Rotation)
	- Rotation of Light: Certain non-centrosymmetric lattice structures, such as trigonal, possess optical activity, meaning they can rotate the plane of polarization of light as it passes through. This is vital for optical communication devices.

4. Defects and Coloration
	- Localized States: Defects in the lattice—such as vacancies (missing atoms), interstitials (extra atoms), or foreign dopants—introduce localized energy states within the bandgap.
	- Color Centers: These imperfections can absorb specific wavelengths of light, causing materials that would otherwise be transparent to exhibit specific colors.

5. Nonlinear Optical Properties
	- Frequency Conversion: Crystals with low-symmetry lattices (non-centrosymmetric) can exhibit strong nonlinear optical properties, such as Second Harmonic Generation (SHG), where the material converts incident light to a higher frequency (e.g., turning infrared light into visible light).

6. Lattice Vibrations (Phonons)
	- Infrared Absorption: The lattice structure dictates the frequency of atomic vibrations (phonons). In polar crystals, these vibrations interact with infrared light, resulting in characteristic reflection and absorption spectra.

7. Surface and Structural Regulation
	- Light Extraction Efficiency: Changes in the lattice structure (e.g., manipulating the atomic layers, such as in GaN or Si) can alter the reflection and refraction of light, allowing for higher light extraction efficiency in LEDs.
	- Photonics: In periodic, artificial, or engineered lattices (photonic crystals), the structure can form a "photonic bandgap," preventing certain frequencies of light from propagating through, allowing for precise light localization.

| Birefringence      | Occurs in low-symmetry lattices, splitting light.          |
| Transparency/Color | Determined by bandgap, altered by lattice spacing/strains. |
| Nonlinear Optics   | High in non-centrosymmetric, low-symmetry structures.      |
| Scattering         | Minimized in high-quality single crystal lattices.         |
