# The Alchemic Script

> [!important] The Alchemic Script is heavily based on Jakub Marian's [Universal Phonetic Alphabet](https://www.omniglot.com/conscripts/upa.htm).
> There are a few adjustments I want to make, so that I can :
> - Indicate when different language is used
> - Use notations that look aesthetically fitting
> - Write vertically if possible
> 
> I do feel somewhat limited by this script, in a sense that giving it anymore visual functionality is an overkill. I need to pick up 

#todo consider learning  (by Jakub Marian).

#todo you need to learn [IPA](https://jakubmarian.com/international-phonetic-alphabet-ipa-for-english-vowels/) first in order to use UPA. This [interactive IPA chart](https://www.ipachart.com/) should help. Also, use [toPhonetics](https://tophonetics.com/) to convert Enligsh to IPA.

According to IPA, General American typically features :
- Consonants (24): These include p, b, t, d, k, g, f, v, θ, ð, s, z, ʃ, ʒ, h, tʃ, dʒ, m, n, ŋ, l, r, w, j.
- Vowels (14-16): The vowel system includes vowels such as i, ɪ, eɪ, ɛ, æ, ɑ, ɔ, oʊ, ʊ, u, ʌ, ə, aɪ, aʊ, ɔɪ.

> left consonant in a box is *voiceless*, and the right is *voiced*.


> [!important] Phonemic vs. Phonetic
> The `/ /` represents **phonemic**, the abstract representation of sound. The `[ ]` represents **phonetic**, the actual produced/observed sound.

Approximants (semi-vowel)
/w/: **wi**n, q**uee**n
- Sometimes **/ʍ/** or **/hw/** is used for "wh" sound where "h" sound is not prominent but it is still more "breathier" than "w" sound (e.g. *which* or *whale*).
/j/ (y): **y**es, **y**ou

> [!important] It seems GA sound of "r" (in words like *red* or *try*) is often denoted as **/ɹ/** as opposed to **/r/**.
> This is because **/r/** is a voiced alveolar trill (Spanish sounding), whereas **/ɹ/** is voiced alveolar approximant (English sounding). In American English, the sound is often further back in the mouth, technically a voiced post-alveolar approximant **/ɹ̠/**.

> Distinctive features of vowels : [Height](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel#Height) (low-mid-high), [Backness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel#Backness) (back-central-front), [Tenseness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenseness) (tense-lax), [Roundedness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roundedness) (rounded-unrounded)

tense vs. lax : tense vowels are produced with greater muscular effort, longer duration, and more peripheral tongue positioning. Conversely, lax vowels are produced with less muscular effort, shorter duration, and a more centralized tongue position. Tense vowels often appear in open syllables, whereas lax vowels are restricted to closed syllables.

> [!important] The difference between **/e/** and **/ɛ/**
> **/e/** is a close-mid front unrounded vowel, and in GA, it is only used as first part of the diphthong **/eɪ/** glide. Although it sounds similar to **/ɛ/** (open-mid front unrounded vowel), jaw is more closed and tongue is closer to the roof of the mouth - using **/e/** instead of **/ɛ/** in words like "bed" (**/bɛd/**) can make the word sound closer to "bid" (**/bɪd/**).


> [!important] Watch out for mergers.
> - **Caught-Cot/Lot-Palm-Thought Merger** : The vowel in "cot" (/ɑ/ or /ɒ/) merges with the vowel in "caught" (/ɔ/); half of GA speakers use /ɑ/ for both "caught" and "cot".
> - **Pin-Pen Merger** : In some dialects, "pin" and "pen" sound the same.
> - **Mary-Marry-Merry Merger** : In most American accents, the vowels in _Mary_ (/ɛər/), _marry_ (/ær/), and _merry_ (/ɛr/) have merged before a prevocalic 'r', making all three words homophones.
> - **Weak Vowel Merger (/ɪ/–/ə/):** In unstressed syllables, the KIT vowel (/ɪ/) often merges with the COMMA vowel (/ə/). This causes pairs like _affected_ and _effected_ to sound identical.
> - **Hurry–Furry Merger (/ʌr/–/ɜːr/):** The vowel in _hurry_ (/ʌ/) often merges with the NURSE vowel (/ɜːr/ or /ər/), meaning they are pronounced with the same sound.
> - **Wine–Whine Merger (/w/–/hw/):** The voiceless labial-velar fricative /hw/ has merged with the voiced /w/ for the vast majority of American speakers, making "wine" and "whine" homophones.
> - **Southern /l/ Mergers** : Feel–Fill (/i/–/ɪ/), Fail–Fell (/eɪ/–/ɛ/)

> [!warning] As a personal preference, I'll use postvocalic **/r/** instead of rhotic vowels.
> Examples of [rhotic (r-colored) vowels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel#Backness) :
> - **/ɝ/** (r-colored): b**ir**d, p**ur**ple
> - **/ɚ/** (unstressed r): broth**er**

#### Consonants

Consonants are defined by two "large" parameters and one "small" parameter.

Large parameters (there are many possible combinations of both) :
- [manner of articulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manner_of_articulation)
- [place of articulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_of_articulation)

 Small parameter (it takes only two possible values) :
 - voiced/voiceless
 
For the indication of the value the following symbols are used :

![[Pasted image 20260125180421.png | center]]

The slash-like symbol is sort of central, the rounded symbols are somewhat opposite of the spiky ones. However, they also maintain a linguistical logic. There will actually be more symbols, but those additional symbols are used for rarely used (and sort of complementary) concepts.

The slash-like symbol is

> [Manner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manner_of_articulation) (left columns) and [Place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_of_articulation) (top columns). Dotted symbols indicate "voiced" consonants (though there are exceptions).
> See also [IPA consonant chart with audio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPA_consonant_chart_with_audio)





#### Vowels


![[Pasted image 20260125175404.png]]

Know the difference between long vowels and short vowels. Common vowels in English :
- A: /eɪ/ rake /reɪk/ (not /raɪk/, which would be Germanic reich)
- E: /iː/ seem /siːm/
- I: /aɪ/ rice /raɪs/ (not /reɪs/, which would be race)
- O: /oʊ/ dote /doʊt/ (not /daʊt/, which would be doubt)
- U: /juː/ use /juːz/

Note that vowel length is not phonemic in General American, and therefore vowels such as /i/ are customarily transcribed without the length mark /ː/.
