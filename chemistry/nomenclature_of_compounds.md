# Nomenclature of Compounds

## Ionic Binary Compounds

A binary ionic compound is a compound made of :
- Two elements only
- A metal (cation, positive ion)
- A nonmetal (anion, negative ion)


### Ionic Bond

#define **Ionic Bond** is a strong electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions (a cation and an anion) formed when one atom completely transfers valence electrons to another.
- Primarily occurring between metals and non-metals, this bond results from the electrostatic attraction between positive and negative ions, creating neutral, high-melting-point, solid compounds (e.g. sodium chloride).

> [!important] An atom of an element has a **neutral charge in its base**, uncombined state. This neutrality occurs because the number of positively charged protons in the nucleus exactly equals the number of negatively charged electrons. If an atom gains or loses electrons, it becomes a charged ion.
> When an atom of a metal element and an atom of non-metal element are combined, the atom of the metal element typically loses an electron to form **cation**. Meanwhile, the atom of the non-metal element typically gains an electron to form **anion**.

#define **Ionic charge** is the net electrical charge (+ or -) on an atom or molecule resulting from the loss or gain of electrons. It represents the imbalance between protons (positive) and electrons (negative), determining an ion's reactivity and bonding behavior.

#example Sodium chloride (NaCl) is an ionic compound. Sodium (Na) is the metal element, which forms a cation with +1 charge. Chlorine (Cl) is the non-metal element, which forms an anion with -1 charge. Together, they have neutral charge.

> [!important] Each element has "tendency" to lose or gain certain amount of electrons.
> In general, it's easy to remember that **Main Groups 1~3** are metals that form cations with **+1~3 charge** (respectively), and **Main Groups 5~7** are non-metals that form anions with **-3~1 charge** (respectively).

> [!warning] Many transition metals can have more than one possible positive charge. In this case, Roman numerals are used to indicate its charge.
> For example, iron (Fe) can form a cation with +2 or +3 charge. An iron with +2 charge is named iron(II). With +3 charge, it is iron(III).

> [!important] In general, in order for ionic bond to occur, the charges must add up to zero. In other words, there should be just as much negative charge as there is positive charge.
> For example, Magnesium (Mg) typically forms a cation with +2 charge. A non-metal element must be one atom with -2 charge (e.g. 1 Oxygen atom) or two atoms with each -1 charge (e.g. 2 Chlorine atoms).


### Basic Naming Rules

For most binary ionic compounds,
> Name = Cation name + Anion name (with -ide ending)

Follow these steps :
1. Name the metal first
	- Use the element's name exactly as written
	- (If necessary) use Roman numerals
2. Name the nonmental second
	- Take the root of the element name
	- Add -ide suffix

Examples :
- NaCl --> Sodium Chloride
- MgO --> Magnesium Oxide
- FeCl₂ --> iron(II) chloride
- FeCl₃ --> iron(III) chloride

> [!warning] There are no prefixes involved with naming ionic binary compounds.


## Molecular Binary Compounds


### Covalent Bond

#define A **Covalent Bond** is a chemical link formed when two non-metal atoms share pairs of valence electrons to achieve stability and fill their outer electron shells.
- These bonds, which create molecules, arise from the electrostatic attraction between positive nuclei and shared negative electrons.
- Key types include polar (unequal sharing) and nonpolar (equal sharing) bonds.
- Covalent bond can occur between two atoms of the same element, forming a molecule.

> [!important] A molecule is two or more atoms chemically bonded together, while a compound is a substance composed of two or more *different* elements bonded together.
> All compounds are technically molecules, but not all molecules are compounds, as molecules can consist of only one element.
> 
> #example O₂ is a molecule, not a compound. MgO is a compound (and a molecule).


### Basic Naming Rules

Biggest thing about naming molecular binary compounds is the fact that prefix is used.

Prefixes :

|Number|Prefix|
|---|---|
|1|mono-|
|2|di-|
|3|tri-|
|4|tetra-|
|5|penta-|
|6|hexa-|
|7|hepta-|
|8|octa-|
|9|nona-|
|10|deca-|

For molecular binary compounds,
> Name = prefix + first element name + prefix + second element name (with -ide ending)

Follow these steps :
1. Name the first element
	- Use the prefix (count the number of atoms)
	- Use the element's name exactly as written
2. Name the second element
	- Use the prefix (count the number of atoms)
	- Take the root of the element name
	- Add -ide suffix

> [!warning] Exception : Mono- prefix is *NOT* used for the first element.

> [!important] Vowel Dropping Rule
> If prefix ends in a vowel and element starts with a vowel, drop one vowel.
> #example mono + oxide --> monoxide
> #example penta + oxide --> pentoxide

---
#example molecular binary compounds naming

CO --> carbon monoxide

CO₂ --> carbon dioxide

N₂O₅ --> dinitrogen pentoxide

SO₃ --> sulfur trioxide


## Inorganic Compounds

#define **Inorganic compounds** are chemical substances that generally lack carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds, distinguishing them from organic compounds. Primarily composed of minerals, metals, and non-metals, these compounds are usually found in non-living matter, such as water, salts, and acids. They typically exhibit high thermal stability, high melting points, and solubility in water.

> [!important] The binary compounds we've gone through so far are inorganic compounds.
> We'll go through inorganic compounds that include polyatomic ions.

### Polyatomic Ion

#define A **Polyatomic Ion** is a charged group of two or more covalently bonded atoms that acts as a single ion.
- Unlike single-atom ions, these charged molecules (or molecular ions) maintain their identity as a group during chemical reactions.
- They are commonly negative (anions) but can be positive (cations).

#define An **Oxyanion** is a negatively charged polyatomic ion that contains oxygen bonded to another element.
- Oxygen is extremely good at stabilizing negative charge, through electronegativity and resonance.

Common polyatomic ions :

| Name                             | Formula | Charge |
| -------------------------------- | ------- | ------ |
| acetate                          | C₂H₃O₂⁻ | −1     |
| ammonium                         | NH₄⁺    | +1     |
| bicarbonate (hydrogen carbonate) | HCO₃⁻   | −1     |
| carbonate                        | CO₃²⁻   | −2     |
| chlorate                         | ClO₃⁻   | −1     |
| chromate                         | CrO₄²⁻  | −2     |
| cyanide                          | CN⁻     | −1     |
| dichromate                       | Cr₂O₇²⁻ | −2     |
| hydroxide                        | OH⁻     | −1     |
| nitrate                          | NO₃⁻    | −1     |
| nitrite                          | NO₂⁻    | −1     |
| permanganate                     | MnO₄⁻   | −1     |
| phosphate                        | PO₄³⁻   | −3     |
| sulfate                          | SO₄²⁻   | −2     |
| sulfite                          | SO₃²⁻   | −2     |


#### Memorization Tips


Memorize the "-ate" version of *oxyanions* :

| Base Element | -ate Ion             | Charge |
| ------------ | -------------------- | ------ |
| Carbon       | CO₃²⁻ (carbonate)    | −2     |
| Chlorine     | ClO₃⁻ (chlorate)     | −1     |
| Chromium     | CrO₄²⁻ (chromate)    | −2     |
| Manganese    | MnO₄⁻ (permanganate) | −1     |
| Nitrogen     | NO₃⁻ (nitrate)       | −1     |
| Phosphorus   | PO₄³⁻ (phosphate)    | −3     |
| Sulfur       | SO₄²⁻ (sulfate)      | −2     |

No need to memorize the "-ite" versions. "-ite" indicates one less oxygen than "-ate". Thus, you only need to memorize "-ate" versions.
- Overall charge stays identical despite the removal of one oxygen atom.
- "hypo-" prefix further reduces the oxygen count to "-ite", whereas "per-" prefix adds one to "-ate". Meaning, "per-..-ate" > "-ate" > "-ite" > "hypo-..-ite"

Memorize the oddballs :

| Name      | Formula | Charge |
| --------- | ------- | ------ |
| ammonium  | NH₄⁺    | +1     |
| hydroxide | OH⁻     | -1     |
| cyanide   | CN⁻     | -1     |
| acetate   | C₂H₃O₂⁻ | -1     |

If hydrogen is added to an oxyanion, charge becomes 1 less negative.
- #example carbonate (CO₃²⁻) has charge of -2. When hydrogen is added, it becomes bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻), which has charge of -1.


### Basic Naming Rules

Because we are dealing with polyatomic ions, we will somewhat follow the naming rules for ionic binary compounds :
> Name = Cation + Anion

However, because polyatomic ions can be either cations or anions, it can be :
- Metal + polyatomic anion
- Polyatomic cation + non-metal
- Polyatomic cation + polyatomic anion

> [!warning] "-ide" suffix does *NOT* apply to polyatomic ion.

> [!warning] If the metal has multiple charges, Roman numerals are still being used!
> #example Fe(NO₃)₂ --> iron(II) nitrate

> [!important] When writing formulas, if more than one polyatomic ion is needed, use parentheses.
> #example calcium nitrate --> Ca²⁺ + NO₃⁻ = Ca(NO₃)₂

---
#example **Metal + polyatomic anion** :
- NaNO₃ --> sodium nitrate
- CaCO₃ --> calcium carbonate
- FeSO₄ --> iron(II) sulfate
- K₂Cr₂O₇ --> potassium dichromate


#example **Polyatomic cation + non-metal** :
- NH₄Cl --> ammonium chloride
- NH₄Br --> ammonium bromide
- (NH₄)₂S --> ammonium sulfide


#example **Polyatomic cation + non-metal** :
- (NH₄)₂SO₄ --> ammonium sulfate
- NH₄NO₃ --> ammonium nitrate
- (NH₄)₃PO₄ --> ammonium phosphate


## Acid

#define H⁺ is a **proton ion** (or just proton) is a hydrogen atom that has lost its single electron, leaving behind only the positively charged nucleus. It is also referred to as hydrogen ion or hydrogen cation.
- Due to its tiny size and positive charge, a free proton is extremely reactive and rarely exists alone in aqueous solutions, typically forming hydronium ions (H_3O^+) or higher clusters.
- Proton ions are the defining species for acidity in aqueous solutions. A lower pH directly indicates a higher concentration of H⁺ ions.

#define By the Arrhenius definition, an **Acid** is a substance that produces H⁺ in water.
- Brønsted–Lowry definition, an acid is a **proton donor**.
- Acids almost always start with hydrogen, which means it has hydrogen written first in the formula (e.g. HCl, H₂SO₄, HNO₃)


### Binary Acid

#define A **Binary Acid** is an acid that contains hydrogen and one non-metal without oxygen.
- Binary acids are only considered acids when in an aqueous state (aq).

> [!important] Key identification criteria for binary acids
> 1. Formula Structure : Starts with H (Hydrogen) and has **only one** other element (non-metal).
> 2. No Oxygen
> 3. Liquid State
> 4. Nonmetal Element : Usually a halogen or sulfur.

#example Binary acids include :
- Hydrofluoric acid - HF(aq)
- Hydrochloric acid - HCl(aq)
- Hydrobromic acid - HBr(aq)
- Hydroiodic acid - HI(aq)
- Hydrosulfuric acid (H₂S)

> [!important] If a binary compound is not in aqueous state, then it follows the binary compound naming convention.
> For example, HCl(g) or HCl(s) is named hydrogen chloride (binary covalent compound); NOT hydrochloric acid.


#### Basic Naming Rules

Binary acids follow this naming pattern :
> Name = hydro- + root of non-metal + -ic + acid


### Oxyacid

#define An **Oxyacid** is an acid that contains hydrogen, non-metal, and oxygen.
- Oxyacids usually come from oxyanions. Basically, oxyacids are oxyanions with hydrogen added.

#example Oxyacids :
- HNO₃ --> nitric acid
- HNO₂ --> nitrous acid
- H₂SO₄ --> sulfuric acid
- H₂SO₃ --> sulfurous acid
- H₂CO₃ --> carbonic acid
- HClO₃ --> chloric acid


#### Basic Naming Rules

Oxyacids follow this naming pattern :

|If anion ends in|Acid ends in|
|---|---|
|-ate|-ic acid|
|-ite|-ous acid|

> [!important] There is no "hydro-" prefix.

> [!important] "hypo-" or "per-" prefixes stays as they are.
