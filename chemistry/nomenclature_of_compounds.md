# Nomenclature of Compounds

## Ionic Binary Compounds

A binary ionic compound is a compound made of :
- Two elements only
- A metal (cation, positive ion)
- A nonmetal (anion, negative ion)


### Basic Naming Rules

For most binary ionic compounds,
> Name = Cation name + Anion name (with -ide ending)

Follow these steps :
1. Name the metal first
	- Use the element's name exactly as written
2. Name the nonmental second
	- Take the root of the element name
	- Add -ide suffix

Examples :
- NaCl --> Sodium Chloride
- MgO --> Magnesium Oxide

> [!warning] There are no prefixes involved with naming ionic binary compounds.


### Ionic Charge

#define **Ionic charge** is the net electrical charge (+ or -) on an atom or molecule resulting from the loss or gain of electrons. It represents the imbalance between protons (positive) and electrons (negative), determining an ion's reactivity and bonding behavior.
- Metals typically lose electrons, forming a cation with a positive ionic charge.
- Non-metals typically gain electrons, forming an anion with a negative ionic charge.
