# Nomenclature of Compounds

## Ionic Binary Compounds

A binary ionic compound is a compound made of :
- Two elements only
- A metal (cation, positive ion)
- A nonmetal (anion, negative ion)


### Ionic Charge

#define **Ionic Bond** is a strong electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions (a cation and an anion) formed when one atom completely transfers valence electrons to another.
- Primarily occurring between metals and non-metals, this bond results from the electrostatic attraction between positive and negative ions, creating neutral, high-melting-point, solid compounds (e.g. sodium chloride).

> [!important] An atom of an element has a **neutral charge in its base**, uncombined state. This neutrality occurs because the number of positively charged protons in the nucleus exactly equals the number of negatively charged electrons. If an atom gains or loses electrons, it becomes a charged ion.
> When an atom of a metal element and an atom of non-metal element are combined, the atom of the metal element typically loses an electron to form **cation**. Meanwhile, the atom of the non-metal element typically gains an electron to form **anion**.

#define **Ionic charge** is the net electrical charge (+ or -) on an atom or molecule resulting from the loss or gain of electrons. It represents the imbalance between protons (positive) and electrons (negative), determining an ion's reactivity and bonding behavior.

#example Sodium chloride (NaCl) is an ionic compound. Sodium (Na) is the metal element, which forms a cation with +1 charge. Chlorine (Cl) is the non-metal element, which forms an anion with -1 charge. Together, they have neutral charge.

> [!important] Each element has "tendency" to lose or gain certain amount of electrons.
> In general, it's easy to remember that **Main Groups 1~3** are metals that form cations with **+1~3 charge** (respectively), and **Main Groups 5~7** are non-metals that form anions with **-3~1 charge** (respectively).

> [!warning] Many transition metals can have more than one possible positive charge. In this case, Roman numerals are used to indicate its charge.
> For example, iron (Fe) can form a cation with +2 or +3 charge. An iron with +2 charge is named iron(II). With +3 charge, it is iron(III).

> [!important] In general, in order for ionic bond to occur, the charges must add up to zero. In other words, there should be just as much negative charge as there is positive charge.
> For example, Magnesium (Mg) typically forms a cation with +2 charge. A non-metal element must be one atom with -2 charge (e.g. 1 Oxygen atom) or two atoms with each -1 charge (e.g. 2 Chlorine atoms).


### Basic Naming Rules

For most binary ionic compounds,
> Name = Cation name + Anion name (with -ide ending)

Follow these steps :
1. Name the metal first
	- Use the element's name exactly as written
	- (If necessary) use Roman numerals
2. Name the nonmental second
	- Take the root of the element name
	- Add -ide suffix

Examples :
- NaCl --> Sodium Chloride
- MgO --> Magnesium Oxide
- FeCl₂ --> iron(II) chloride
- FeCl₃ --> iron(III) chloride

> [!warning] There are no prefixes involved with naming ionic binary compounds.
