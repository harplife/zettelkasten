# Nomenclature of Compounds

## Ionic Binary Compounds

A binary ionic compound is a compound made of :
- Two elements only
- A metal (cation, positive ion)
- A nonmetal (anion, negative ion)


### Ionic Bond

#define **Ionic Bond** is a strong electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions (a cation and an anion) formed when one atom completely transfers valence electrons to another.
- Primarily occurring between metals and non-metals, this bond results from the electrostatic attraction between positive and negative ions, creating neutral, high-melting-point, solid compounds (e.g. sodium chloride).

> [!important] An atom of an element has a **neutral charge in its base**, uncombined state. This neutrality occurs because the number of positively charged protons in the nucleus exactly equals the number of negatively charged electrons. If an atom gains or loses electrons, it becomes a charged ion.
> When an atom of a metal element and an atom of non-metal element are combined, the atom of the metal element typically loses an electron to form **cation**. Meanwhile, the atom of the non-metal element typically gains an electron to form **anion**.

#define **Ionic charge** is the net electrical charge (+ or -) on an atom or molecule resulting from the loss or gain of electrons. It represents the imbalance between protons (positive) and electrons (negative), determining an ion's reactivity and bonding behavior.

#example Sodium chloride (NaCl) is an ionic compound. Sodium (Na) is the metal element, which forms a cation with +1 charge. Chlorine (Cl) is the non-metal element, which forms an anion with -1 charge. Together, they have neutral charge.

> [!important] Each element has "tendency" to lose or gain certain amount of electrons.
> In general, it's easy to remember that **Main Groups 1~3** are metals that form cations with **+1~3 charge** (respectively), and **Main Groups 5~7** are non-metals that form anions with **-3~1 charge** (respectively).

> [!warning] Many transition metals can have more than one possible positive charge. In this case, Roman numerals are used to indicate its charge.
> For example, iron (Fe) can form a cation with +2 or +3 charge. An iron with +2 charge is named iron(II). With +3 charge, it is iron(III).

> [!important] In general, in order for ionic bond to occur, the charges must add up to zero. In other words, there should be just as much negative charge as there is positive charge.
> For example, Magnesium (Mg) typically forms a cation with +2 charge. A non-metal element must be one atom with -2 charge (e.g. 1 Oxygen atom) or two atoms with each -1 charge (e.g. 2 Chlorine atoms).


### Basic Naming Rules

For most binary ionic compounds,
> Name = Cation name + Anion name (with -ide ending)

Follow these steps :
1. Name the metal first
	- Use the element's name exactly as written
	- (If necessary) use Roman numerals
2. Name the nonmental second
	- Take the root of the element name
	- Add -ide suffix

Examples :
- NaCl --> Sodium Chloride
- MgO --> Magnesium Oxide
- FeCl₂ --> iron(II) chloride
- FeCl₃ --> iron(III) chloride

> [!warning] There are no prefixes involved with naming ionic binary compounds.


## Molecular Binary Compounds


### Covalent Bond

#define A **Covalent Bond** is a chemical link formed when two non-metal atoms share pairs of valence electrons to achieve stability and fill their outer electron shells.
- These bonds, which create molecules, arise from the electrostatic attraction between positive nuclei and shared negative electrons.
- Key types include polar (unequal sharing) and nonpolar (equal sharing) bonds.
- Covalent bond can occur between two atoms of the same element, forming a molecule.

> [!important] A molecule is two or more atoms chemically bonded together, while a compound is a substance composed of two or more *different* elements bonded together.
> All compounds are technically molecules, but not all molecules are compounds, as molecules can consist of only one element.
> 
> #example O₂ is a molecule, not a compound. MgO is a compound (and a molecule).


### Basic Naming Rules

Biggest thing about naming molecular binary compounds is the fact that prefix is used.

Prefixes :

|Number|Prefix|
|---|---|
|1|mono-|
|2|di-|
|3|tri-|
|4|tetra-|
|5|penta-|
|6|hexa-|
|7|hepta-|
|8|octa-|
|9|nona-|
|10|deca-|

For molecular binary compounds,
> Name = prefix + first element name + prefix + second element name (with -ide ending)

Follow these steps :
1. Name the first element
	- Use the prefix (count the number of atoms)
	- Use the element's name exactly as written
2. Name the second element
	- Use the prefix (count the number of atoms)
	- Take the root of the element name
	- Add -ide suffix

> [!warning] Exception : Mono- prefix is *NOT* used for the first element.

> [!important] Vowel Dropping Rule
> If prefix ends in a vowel and element starts with a vowel, drop one vowel.
> #example mono + oxide --> monoxide
> #example penta + oxide --> pentoxide

#example molecular binary compounds naming

CO --> carbon monoxide

CO₂ --> carbon dioxide

N₂O₅ --> dinitrogen pentoxide

SO₃ --> sulfur trioxide


## Inorganic Nomenclature

### Polyatomic Ion

#define A **Polyatomic Ion** is a charged group of two or more covalently bonded atoms that acts as a single ion.
- Unlike single-atom ions, these charged molecules (or molecular ions) maintain their identity as a group during chemical reactions.
- They are commonly negative (anions) but can be positive (cations).
