## Modern Discoveries

> [!warning] Discovery of Compound vs. Element
> Some elements (e.g. Be, B, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Mn, Co, Ni, Zr, Mo) were widely known since medieval or even ancient times, but they were discovered as their compounded forms, not as an element. It is questionable whether it can be said to be "discovered" at all.
> 
> Not only that, the nature of those compounds was sometimes only gradually discovered, thus posing a difficulty in naming one specific discoverer.
