## Interaction of Light and Material

## Properties of Light

Main properties :
- Reflection
- Absorption
- Transmission
- Scattering

Special properties :
- Emission


### Reflection

Light bounces off the surface.

- Happens at the boundary between two materials (air --> solid)
- Can be :
	- Specular (mirror-like)
	- Diffuse (scattered)
- What controls it :
	- Surface smoothness
	- Electron mobility
	- Refractive index

#### Specular Reflection

- Light reflects almost immedicately
- Direction preserved

This gives highlights and mirrors


#### Diffuse Reflection

- Light enters slightly
- Bounces between molecules
- Exits randomly

This is why matte surfaces look matte.

> [!note] So is this direct result of texture? How can metals have matte finish?


### Absorption

Light energy is taken in by the material.

- Energy goes into :
	- Electron excitation
	- Molecular vibration (heat)
- Results :
	- Material appears colored (mix of reflection and absorption)
	- Material heats up


### Transmission

Light passes through the material.

- Happens in :
	- Glass
	- Water
	- Plastic
	- Skin (partially)
- Can be :
	- Clear (straight through)
	- Tinted (some wavelengths absorbed or scattered)

> [!warning] Light does *not* pass through without interacting at all.
> Even transparent materials interact, but just weakly.


#### Refraction

- Light bends as it enters or exits a material
- Caused by speed change inside the material

Important for :
- Lenses
- Glass
- Water
- Eyes


### Scattering

Light changes direction inside the material.

> [!note] How does it relate to refraction?
> Or is scattering specifically collision with electrons?

- Can be :
	- Forward
	- Backward
	- Sideways
- Results :
	- Milk looks white
	- Skin looks soft
	- Marble glows at edges


#### Subsurface Scattering (SSS)

- Light enters
- Scatters internally
- Exits somewhere else

Critical for :
- Skin
- Wax
- Leaves
- Food


### Emission

The material produces light itself.

Examples :
- LEDs
- Fire
- Hot metal (incandescence) & blackbody radiation

Chemically :
- Excited electrons drop energy levels
- Emit photons
