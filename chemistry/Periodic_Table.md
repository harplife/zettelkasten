# Periodic Table of the Elements

![[Periodic_table_large.svg]]


The **Period** (row) dictates how many shells are present.

**Electron Shells** : The specific, quantized energy levels or "orbits" surrounding an atomic nucelus where electrons are located. They represent the distance of electrons from the nucelus, with inner shells holding lower energy and filling first.
- Valence Shell : Outermost shell, usually determines chemical properties
- Electrons in atoms fill shells following a specific, predictable pattern based on energy levels and quantum mechanics. The max number of electrons in each shell follows the 2n^2 formula (where n is the shell number), resulting in 2, 8, 18, and 32 electrons for the first four shells.


**Subshells** : Subdivisions of electron shells within an atom, defined by the azimuthal quantum number (l) and labeled as s, p, d, or f, based on their shape.
- d shell determine metals properties
- subshells contain one or more orbitals


**Atomic Orbitals** : 3D regions of space around an atom's nucleus where there is a high probability of finding electrons. They represent the quantum mechanical, wave-like behavior of electrons, with each specific orbital able to hold a maximum of two electrons with paired spins. Orbitals are categorized by shapes (s, p, d, f) and energy levels.



The **Group** (column) determines the **reactivity** and **bonding behavior** based on the outer electrons.

The Main Group elements (Representative elements) consists of elements in groups 1, 2, and 13~18, spanning the s- and p-blocks. These 44+ elements are essential to life, abundant in nature, and exhibit regular, predictable periodic trends in reactivity and properties.
- Unlike transition metals (groups 3~12), main group elements usually have consistent oxidation states and are not characterized by filling d or f orbitals.
- Groups 1–2 (s-blocks): The group number equals the number of valence electrons.
- Groups 13–18 (p-blocks) : The digit in the ones place of the group number equals the number of valence electrons (e.g., Group 16 has 6 valence electrons).

**Transition Metals** are elements characterized by having partially filled d-electron orbitals.
- Groups 3~12 (the d-block) of the periodic table
- They are generally hard, dense, lustrous metals with high melting points, acting as strong conductors of heat and electricity.
- These elements are known for forming colored compounds, having multiple oxidation states, and serving as catalysts.


A **Semimetal**, often called a metalloid, is an element with properties intermediate between those of metals and nonmetals, typically having a metallic, shiny luster while being brittle, not malleable, and functioning as semiconductors.


**Non-metals** are a group of chemical elements (such as carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen) that lack characteristic metallic properties: they are poor conductors of heat and electricity, have low densities, and are usually brittle when solid. Situated on the right side of the periodic table, they can be gases, liquids, or solids, typically forming negative ions (anions) by gaining electrons in chemical reactions.
