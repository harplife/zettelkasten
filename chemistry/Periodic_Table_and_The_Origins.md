# Nucleosynthesis Periodic Table

This is a periodic table that shows the origin(s) of each element.
- We can see that all of Hydrogen comes from the Big Bang. Most of Helium comes from the Big Bang as well, but some part of it comes from dying low-mass stars and exploding massive stars.

## General Notes

- The Big Bang primarily formed the lightest elements in the universe within the first few minutes, specifically [[1 - Hydrogen (H)|Hydrogen]] (~75%), [[2 - Helium (He)|Helium]] (~25%), and trace amounts of [[3 - Lithium (Li)|Lithium]] and deuterium (an isotope of hydrogen).
