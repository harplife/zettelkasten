# Lithium (Li)

## Chemical Properties

- Highly reactive, especially with water and air
	- Reacts with water to form lithium hydroxide (LiOH) and hydrogen gas
	- Stored under oil to prevent reaction with air
- Forms +1 ions (Li⁺) in compounds

> [!important] Lithium really wants to lose one electron, which makes it chemically active.


## Physical Properties

- Solid state at room temperature
- Soft, silvery-white metal
- Very low density; the lightest metal
- Atomic number 3 (3 protons, 3 electrons)


## Common Uses

- Lithium-ion batteries (for phones, laptops, electric vehicles, etc.)
- Alloys (lightweight, strong materials for aerospace)
- Fireworks and flares (produces a bright crimson-red flame)


### Notable Compounds

| Color            | Wavelength (nm) |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| Deep crimson red | ~670.8 nm       |
| Weak orange-red  | ~610 nm         |
| Weak blue-violet | ~460 nm         |

> [!important] Lithium produces one of the purest red flame colors.


### Absorption Spectrum

- Same as emission spectrum


## Fun Facts

- Lithium was formed in small amounts during the Big Bang.
- Used medically to stabilize mood (bipolar, specifically). It is one of the few elements used directly in psychiatry.
- The modern electronics revolution depends heavily on lithium chemistry.


## Discovery

- When : 1817
- Who : Johan August Arfwedson
- How :
	- Analyzed a mineral (petalite)
	- Found an unknown element chemically similar to sodium and potassium
	- Element was late isolated as a metal

> [!important] The term *Lithium* originates from the Greek word *lithos* meaning "stone" - this is because it was discovered in minerals.
