# Lithium (Li)

## Chemical Properties

- Highly reactive, especially with water and air
	- Reacts with water to form lithium hydroxide (LiOH) and hydrogen gas
	- Stored under oil to prevent reaction with air
- Forms +1 ions (Li⁺) in compounds

> [!important] Lithium really wants to lose one electron, which makes it chemically active.


## Physical Properties

- Solid state at room temperature
- Soft, silvery-white metal
- Very low density; the lightest metal
- Atomic number 3 (3 protons, 3 electrons)


## Common Uses

- Lithium-ion batteries (for phones, laptops, electric vehicles, etc.)
- Alloys (lightweight, strong materials for aerospace)
- Fireworks and flares (produces a bright crimson-red flame)
