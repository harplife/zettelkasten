# Helium (He)

## Chemical Properties

- Extremely **unreactive** (called a *noble gas*)
- Does **not burn**
- Does **not normally form compounds**
- Exists as **single atoms**, not molecules

> [!important] Helium's electrons form a very stable arrangement, so helium has almost no "desire" to react with other elemtns.


## Physical Properties

- **Gaseous** state at room temperature
- **Colorless** and **odorless**
- **Very low density** (second-lightest element after [[1 - Hydrogen (H)]])
- **Atomic number 2** (two protons and two electrons)
- Extremely low boiling point (the lowest of any element)
- Cannot be solidified at normal pressure

> [!important] Solid helium
> **Solid Helium** is a unique quantum solid that only forms under extreme pressure (around 25 atmospheres or more) and very low temperature (near absolute zero) because its *high zero-point energy* prevents it from freezing at normal atmospheric pressure. It's known as a "**quantum solid**" due to quantum effects, exhibiting strange behaviors like super-solidity, where it can seemingly flow through itself like a superfluid.

> [!important] Zero-Point Energy
> Helium atoms have high kinetic energy even at absolute zero (0 Kelvin) due to quantum mechanics, meaning they constantly vibrate and resist forming a fixed crystal lattice.


## Atomic Spectra

### Emission Spectrum

Helium has a rich and colorful spectrum, especially when excited by electricity.

| Color (approx.) | Wavelength (nm)  |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| Red             | ~668, ~706       |
| Yellow/Orange   | ~588 nm          |
| Blue-green      | ~470, ~492, ~502 |
| Blue/Violet     | ~402, ~447       |

### Absorption Spectrum

Cool helium gas absorbs light at the same wavelengths.


## Common Uses

- Balloons and airships (lighter than air and non-flammable)
- Cryogenics (cooling MRI machines and superconducting magnets)
- Shielding sensitive equipment
- Leak detection
- Protective atmospheres for welding
- Astronomy


### Notable Compounds

| Compound                          | Formula | Notes                          | Found in Nature or Manufactured? |
| --------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| _(None, under normal conditions)_ | —       | Helium is chemically inert     | —                                |
| **Helium excimers**               | He₂*    | Very short-lived, only in labs | **Manufactured (experimental)**  |

### Production

- Extracted from natural gas deposits
- Produced during radioactive decay underground
- Separated by cryogenic distillation

Top producers :
1. United States
2. Qatar
3. Algeria
4. Russia
5. Australia


## Fun Facts

- Discovered in 1868 in the Sun before being found on Earth (the name comes from Helios, the Greek sun god)
- Helium changes your voice when inhaled (but it is not good to inhale helium)
- Helium on Earth mostly comes from radioactive decay underground
- Helium is a non-renewable resource on Earth - once released, it escapes into space


## Discovery

- When : 1868 (identified), 1895 (isolated on Earth)
- Who :
	- Pierre Janssen and Norman Lockyer (independently)
	- William Ramsay (isolated it on Earth)
- How :
	- Janssen and Lockyer observed unknown yellow spectral lines in sunlight during a solar eclipse.
	- They concluded a new element existed in the Sun.
	- Ramsay later extracted helium from uranium-bearing minerals.


> [!important] Helium was discovered in space before Earth.
