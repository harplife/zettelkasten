# Rubidium (Rb)

![[Pasted image 20260208172704.png | center | 300]]


## Chemical Properties

- Extremely reactive alkali metal (more reactive than lithium, sodium, and potassium)
- Reacts violently with water, producing rubidium hydroxide and hydrogen gas
- Reacts quickly with air and moisture; stored under oil or inert gas
- Forms +1 ions in (Rb⁺) in compounds


## Physical Properties

- State : Solid (but barely, as it will turn to liquid in a warm room)
- Appearance : Soft, silvery-white metal
- Density : Relatively low for a metal
- Melting Point : ~39 °C
- Very soft - can be cut easily with a knife


## Atomic Spectra

### Emission Spectrum

| Color (approx.)           | Wavelength (nm) | Note               |
| ------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------ |
| Visible Red/Near-Infrared | **~780 nm**     | "Rubidium D-Lines" |
| Visible Red/Near-Infrared | **~794 nm**     | "Rubidium D-Lines" |
| Blue/Violet               | ~420.2 nm       |                    |
| Blue/Violet               | ~424.44 nm      |                    |

> [!important] Rubidium's electrons jump in very predictable ways, producing ultra-precise atomic spectra.


### Absorption Spectrum

Same


## Common Uses

- Rubidium atomic clocks
- Laser cooling
- Vacuum tubes

> [!important] Rubidium is not common in everyday products, but it is crucial in high-precision technology.


### Notable Compounds

|Compound|Formula|Use|Found in Nature or Manufactured?|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Rubidium chloride**|RbCl|Chemical research|**Both**|
|**Rubidium nitrate**|RbNO₃|Specialty electronics|**Manufactured**|
|**Rubidium hydroxide**|RbOH|Chemical synthesis|**Manufactured**|
|**Pollucite**|Cs,RbAlSi₂O₆|Main source mineral|**Natural**|


### Production

- Rubidium is **not mined alone**
- Extracted as a **byproduct** during mining of:
    - **Cesium**
    - **Lithium**
- Main source mineral: [pollucite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollucite)
	- ![[Pasted image 20260208174156.png | 200]]
- Isolated using chemical separation techniques


**Top producing countries (approximate):**
1. China
2. Canada
3. Zimbabwe
4. Namibia
5. Brazil


## Fun Facts

- Along with cesium, gallium, and mercury, it is one of the few metals that are liquid near room temp.
- Rubidium atomic clocks are simpler and cheaper than cesium ones.
- Detected in stars using its absorption lines
- Too reactive to exist freely in nature
- The name originates from Latin *rubidius*, meaning "Deep Red", to represent its spectral lines.


## Discovery

- **When:** 1861
- **Who:** **Robert Bunsen** and **Gustav Kirchhoff**
- **How:**
    - Used **spectroscopy**
    - Observed two deep red spectral lines
    - Identified a new element based on its spectrum
