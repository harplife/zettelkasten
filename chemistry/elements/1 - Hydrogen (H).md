# Hydrogen (H)

## Chemical Properties

- Highly reactive, especially with Oxygen
- Flammable; burns with a pale blue flame and produces water
- Usually exists as **diatomic molecule**, rather than single atoms
- Can form **covalent bonds**
- Can form **ions**

> [!important] Hydrogen's behavior depends strongly on its state, what it's bonded to, or what it is inside of.


## Physical Properties

- Gaseous state at room temperature
- Colorless and odorless
- Extremely light - lightest element known
- Atomic number 1 (one proton and one electron) - the simplest element of any element.

### Emission Spectrum

> Purple glow in hydrogen's plasma state

When hydrogen gas is energized (e.g. by electricity), it emits specific colors of light. In the visible range, it produces :

| Color               | Wavelength (nm) |
| ------------------- | --------------- |
| **Deep red**        | **656 nm**      |
| **Blue-green**      | **486 nm**      |
| **Violet**          | **434 nm**      |
| **Violet (dimmer)** | **410 nm**      |

These appear as bright, sharp lines, not a continuous rainbow.

> [!important] The most intense emission line is red (656 nm), often defining the color of excited hydrogen.

> [!important] Hydrogen also emits *UV light* and *IR light*.

### Absorption Spectrum

- If white light passes through cool hydrogen gas, hydrogen absorbs the same colors it would emit.

## Common Uses

- Rocket fuel
- Hydrogen fuel cells
- Making ammonia for fertilizers (Haber process)
- Petroleum refining
- Found in all living things, involved in energy transfer inside cells

### Notable Compounds

|Compound|Formula|Use|Found in Nature or Manufactured?|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Water**|H₂O|Drinking, life, climate|**Both** (natural & manufactured)|
|**Ammonia**|NH₃|Fertilizers, cleaners|**Manufactured** (Haber process)|
|**Methane**|CH₄|Fuel (natural gas)|**Both**|
|**Hydrochloric acid**|HCl|Digestion, industry|**Both**|
|**Hydrogen peroxide**|H₂O₂|Disinfectant, bleaching|**Both** (trace natural, mostly manufactured)|


### Production

- Produced mainly by steam reforming of natural gas.
- Produced also by electrolysis of water.
- Emerging: green hydrogen (renewable electricity)

Top producers :
1. China
2. US
3. India
4. Russia
5. Germany


## Fun Facts

- Most abundant element in the universe (75%), but rare as free hydrogen on Earth.
- The Hindenburg disaster (1937) made hydrogen infamous, through the chemistry was misunderstood at the time.
- A single hydrogen atom nucleus is just a bare proton.
- When hydrogen burns, it doesn't make smoke - it makes water. Because water is already "burned", it cannot be burned anymore.
- Hydrogen spectral lines help us measure how fast galaxies are moving away from us (see Doppler shift).

> [!note] Explosive history of balloons
> Before [[2 - Helium (He)]] was used for balloons, balloons were once filled with hydrogen instead. Of course, people eventually learned that wasn't a great idea because the hydrogen balloons would literally explode.
> 
> See also "[Hindenburg disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindenburg_disaster)", where they filled an air ship *Hindenburg* with Hydrogen gas - which resulted in catastrophic explosion.


## Discovery

- When : 1766 (recognized as an element)
- Who : Henry Cavendish
- How :
	- Reacted metals with acids
	- Collected a gas Henry called "inflammable air"
	- Showed it produced water when burned
- Other notes :
	- Antoine Lavoisier named it Hydrogen (Greek for "water former")


## Wave Function

![[Pasted image 20260124091731.png]]

Hydrogen density plots for n up to 4. Wavefunctions of the electron in a hydrogen atom at different energy levels. Quantum mechanics cannot predict the exact location of a particle in space, only the probability of finding it at different locations. The brighter areas represent a higher probability of finding the electron.
