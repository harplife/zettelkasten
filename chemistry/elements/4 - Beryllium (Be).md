# Beryllium (Be)

![[Pasted image 20260208165955.png | center | 300]]


## Chemical Properties

- Moderately reactive, but much less so than lithium
- Forms a +2 ion (Be²⁺) in compounds
- Unlike most metals, beryllium compounds are often **covalent** rather than ionic
- Forms a thin oxide layer (BeO) on its surface that protects it from further reaction
- Toxic when inhaled as dust or fumes


## Physical Properties

- **State:** Solid
- **Appearance:** Steel-gray, shiny metal
- **Density:** Very low (lighter than aluminum)
- **Very stiff and strong** for its weight
- **High melting point** compared to other light metals
- Transparent to **X-rays** (most transparent solid materials known)

Big physical takeaway :  
Beryllium is **light, rigid, and stable**, which makes it valuable in high-performance applications.


## Atomic Spectra

### Emission

~313 nm (ultraviolet)

Beryllium does not produce a colorful flame, and it requires a special instrument to detect it.


### Absorption

Same


## Common Uses

- Aerospace components : Lightweight and extremely rigid
- Space telescopes : Structural parts and mirrors
- Nuclear reactors : Neutron reflector and moderator
- X-ray windows : Transparent to X-rays but strong


### Notable Compounds

|Compound|Formula|Use|Found in Nature or Manufactured?|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Beryllium oxide**|BeO|Electronics, heat sinks|**Manufactured**|
|**Beryl**|Be₃Al₂Si₆O₁₈|Source mineral; emerald & aquamarine|**Natural**|
