# Hydrogen (H)

## Chemical Properties

- Highly reactive, especially with Oxygen
- Burns easily in air, producing water
- Usually exists as diatomic molecule, rather than single atoms
- Can form covalent bonds
- Can form ions

> [!important] Hydrogen's behavior depends strongly on its state, what it's bonded to, or what it is inside of.


## Physical Properties

- Gaseous state at room temperature
- Colorless and odorless
- Extremely light - lightest element known
- Atomic number 1 (one proton and one electron) - the simplest element of any element.


## Common Uses

- Rocket fuel
- Hydrogen fuel cells
- Making ammonia for fertilizers (Haber process)
- Petroleum refining
- Found in all living things, involved in energy transfer inside cells

< Emission Spectrum >

- When hydrogen gas is energized (e.g. by electricity), it emits specific colors of light. In the visible range, it produces :
	- Violet (410 nm)
	- Blue (434 nm)
	- Blue-green (486 nm)
	- Red (656 nm)
- These appear as bright, sharp lines, not a continuous rainbow.

< Absorption Spectrum >

- If white light passes through cool hydrogen gas, hydrogen absorbs the same colors it would emit.

## Fun Facts

- Most abundant element in the universe (75%), but rare as free hydrogen on Earth.
- The Hindenburg disaster (1937) made hydrogen infamous, through the chemistry was misunderstood at the time.
- A single hydrogen atom nucleus is just a bare proton.
- When hydrogen burns, it doesn't make smoke - it makes water. Because water is already "burned", it cannot be burned anymore.
- Hydrogen spectral lines help us measure how fast galaxies are moving away from us (see Doppler shift).

> [!note] Explosive history of balloons
> Before [[Helium (He)]] was used for balloons, balloons were once filled with hydrogen instead. Of course, people eventually learned that wasn't a great idea because the hydrogen balloons would literally explode.
