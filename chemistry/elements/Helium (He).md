# Helium (He)

## Chemical Properties

- Extremely unreactive (called a *noble gas*)
- Does not burn
- Does not easily form compounds
- Exists as single atoms, not molecules.

> [!important] Helium's electrons form a very stable arrangement, so helium has almost no "desire" to react with other elemtns.


## Physical Properties

- Gaseous state at room temperature
- Colorless and odorless
- Very low density (second-lightest element after [[Hydrogen (H)]])
- Atomic number 2 (two protons and two electrons)
- Extremely low boiling point (the lowest of any element)


## Common Uses

- Balloons and airships (lighter than air and non-flammable)
- Cryogenics (extreme cooling)
- Shielding sensitive equipment
- Leak detection
- Astronomy


## Atomic Spectra

---
< Emission Spectrum >

Helium has a rich and colorful spectrum, especially when excited by electricity.

| Color (approx.) | Wavelength (nm)  |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| Red             | ~668, ~706       |
| Yellow/Orange   | ~588 nm          |
| Blue-green      | ~470, ~492, ~502 |
| Blue/Violet     | ~402, ~447       |

< Absorption Spectrum >

Cool helium gas absorbs light at the same wavelengths.

Helium spectra is important in Astronomy because it is used to :
- Identify stars
- Study stellar temperatures
- Calibrate spectroscopic instruments


## Fun Facts

- Discovered in 1868 in the Sun before being found on Earth (the name comes from Helios, the Greek sun god)
