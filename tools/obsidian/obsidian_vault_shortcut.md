# How to make Obsidian Vault Shortcut
This is a guide to make a Shortcut File that opens an Obsidian Vault.
\*Verified on 2022/02/17

## Requirements
1. Works only with _Installed_ version of Obsidian.
2. The vault must be opened at least ONCE prior to making the shortcut.

## Guide
1. Open a browser. In the address bar, type in [an Obsidian URI for opening a vault](https://help.obsidian.md/Advanced+topics/Using+obsidian+URI#Action+open). For example, `obsidian://open?vault=vault_name`.
2. Highlight the URI and drag it to desktop (or to any opened window). This will create a `.url` file.

## Note
1. Rename the file using only the left click or right click "rename" option. Editing from the properties somehow breaks the file.
2. If the shortcut was made properly, the `.url` file will use the Obsidian icon. Otherwise, it will use default `.url` file icon (which looks like a globe).
