# Obsidian Tabs
This is an [[what_is_obsidian|Obsidian]] community plugin for enabling Tabs (like a browser, or VS Code).
This is useful for keeping track of notes I'm currently working on.

[Official Github](https://github.com/gitobsidiantutorial/obsidian-tabs)

It's supposed to be paired with [pane-relief](https://github.com/pjeby/pane-relief) plugin. I don't find much use for it though.

## Installation
Easy, go to settings -> Community Plugins -> Safe Mode Off -> Browse -> Click Obsidian Tabs -> Enable

## Getting Started
Easy, just Control + Left Click.

## Initial Thought
I started using it 2021/10/26. By the time I'm writing this, I've used this plugin for like ten minutes (not that it requires more time to REALLY figure it out).

It's not bad - I'm just surprised that it's not a core functionality of Obsidian.

This definitely helps with [[goal_take_notes|Take Notes!]]

## Issues
This "tabs" is not like the tabs I'm familiar with:
- This does not display "current" tab.
- Each tab is like a storage for a single note, and it switches with the note that's displayed on the current pane.
- It's not drag-able.
- Notes open on a single click (which is Obsidian default), on a pane. I'd rather double click and open it on a separate tab.
