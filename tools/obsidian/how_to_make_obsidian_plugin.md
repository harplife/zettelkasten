# How to make a Plugin for Obsidian
Obsidian has its own official plugins (aka Core Plugins) but there aren't many.
Third party plugins (aka Community Plugins) are available, and I can even make it myself if I really tried.

I should make a list of useful plugins #todo

## Forum
The Obsidian [Forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/how-to-get-started-with-developing-a-custom-plugin) is a good place to get an idea of how to get started. It has decent tips on what skills I need, and it has tips for tools I could use.

## Official Guide
The [Official Guide](https://help.obsidian.md/Advanced+topics/Community+plugins) is a must read. It doesn't have much information, but it does have a link to a sample plugin, and a link to the documentation on the Plugin API.
