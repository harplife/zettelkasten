# What is CRM?
Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is a process in which a business or other organization administers its interections with customers, typically using data analysis to study large amounts of information.

## In layman's terms
CRM is a tool to manage and organize customers and any interactions with them.

I think it's more intuitive to call it "Sales Management", since it's biggest point is the interactions with the customers, which is basically sales.

## Main functions
- list of customers with information such as name, their contact (phone, email), their position (manager, director, etc), and/or their company (i.e. Hyundai).
- list of projects with information such as name, status (inquiry, estimate, contracted, completed), POC, start date, end date, etc.
- list of products
- periodic report of sales with information such as # of inquries, contracts, customers
- internal management such as news, knowledge sharing, project progress monitoring, AAR, etc.
