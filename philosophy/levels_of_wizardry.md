# Levels of Wizardry
This is an excerpt translated from _무한전생 - 엘름 연대기_ by 광악, at the first episode of the first chapter.

## Level 0
0 means "nothingness"; the person is not a wizard but an ordinary person.

## Level 1
1 means "identity" and "start"; the person has recognition of oneself as a wizard - a beginner.

## Level 2
2 means "awareness" and "division"; the person has awareness of self and others, in the sense of _mana_.

## Level 3
3 means "balance"; the person has reached the balance between the body, the mind, and the mana.

## Level 4
4 means "change"; the person has recognition of their aptitude in the field of magic.

## Level 5
5 means "harmony"; the person is proficient with _the Five Elements_.
This is the level at which one can proudly refer to oneself as a Wizard.

## Level 6
6 is the result of 2x3, the _division(2)_ of the _balance(3)_ and the _balance(3)_ of the _division(2)_. In other words, "variance" and "prosperity"; the person has awareness of the interaction between the world and the self. At this level, the person's mana drastically increase, and is ready to advance to the next level (7).

## Level 7
7 means "perfection"; the person has mastery of _the Five Elements_, _the Divine Magic_, and _the Dark Magic_. This is the highest level of Wizardry known to humankind, and the person at this level is referred to as _the Arch Wizard_.

## Level 8
8 is the result of 2x4, the _awareness(2)_ of the _change(4)_, and the _change(4)_ of the _awareness(2)_. In other words, "chaos". The person is capable of handling _the Chaos Magic_, which is the result of mixing _the Divine Magic_ and _the Dark Magic_.

## Level 9
9 is the result of 3x3, the _balance(3)_ of the Self, the Magic, and the World, in other word, "sovereignty". This is the most stable state that a mortal being can achieve, thereby the strongest. The Arch Wizard who has reached this level can rival that of a dragon.

## Level 10
10 means "transcendence", but also means "destruction" because one achieves the power to turn _anything(1)_ to _nothingness(0)_. The person has the power beyond that of a mortal being; the person is a demigod.

## Level 11
11 means "creation", as _one(1)_ gives birth to _one(1)_. It also means "omniscience",  as it is the _start(1)_ of a _being(1)_, in other words, a _lone(1)_ _being(1)_. The person has the power to create and reached godhood.

## Level 12
12 is the result of 6x2 and 3x4. The _awareness(2)_ of the _variance(6)_ and the _balance(3)_ of the _change(4)_ together forms "Dominion over Time Space Continuum and Causality", in other word, "Omnipotence". The person has authority over their own _dimension_.

## Level 13
13 means "omnipresence", where the _being(1)_ is the _balance(3)_. The existence of the person is _the Law of the World_.
