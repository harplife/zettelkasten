# Illinois Rules of the Road
- The written exam consists of 35 questions, 15 of which will address traffic sign identification, and the remaining 20 will either be multiple-choice or true-false questions.
- Proof of insurance must be shown before the driving exam is administered.

## Driving Examination
### Using turn signals
- Turn signals are required BEFORE:
	- Turning any corner
	- Turning into any driveway, parking lot, or parking space
	- Changing lanes of traffic
	- AFTER passing another vehicle
	- Pulling over to or away from any curb

### Leaving a parking lot or driveway
- You must stop before entering any street from a driveway, parking lot, or alley.
	- There may or may not be a stop sign present.
	- Use turn signal if appropriate.

### Stopping
- Stop behind the white line or crosswalk.
	- If there is no white line or crosswalk, stop before entering the intersection.
- Rolling stops are automatic failures on the driving examination.

### Turning a corner
- When turning a corner from a two-way street onto another two-way street, stay in your own lane and then turn into the lane where you will be driving.
	- Do not cut corners.

### Hill parking
- Signal toward the side of the road where you wish to park.
- Stop your vehicle parallel to the road, within 12 inches of the curb (or edge).
- If you park on a street with curbing, and
	- If your vehicle is heading downhill, turn the front wheels toward the curb.
	- If your vehicle is heading uphill, turn the front wheels away from the curb.
- If you park on a street without curbing (either downhill or uphill), turn the wheels toward the side of the road on which you are parked.
- Set the parking brake and put the gear selector in "Park".
- When leaving the curb, release your parking brake, turn the wheels from the side of the road, and use your turn signal.
	- Look for oncoming traffic. When it is safe, pull away slowly onto the street.

### Turn-about
- Turn-about requires that a vehicle turn left into an alley/roadway/driveway, back out towards the right, and then head to the direction that the vehicle was originally facing.
	- In other words, it's a U-turn with a few fancy steps.
- When you back out, yield to pedestrians and all vehicles.
	- Check all rearview mirrors and look over your right shoulder.
