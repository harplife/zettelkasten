- After successful completion of a driving exam (from class, I'm guessing), the prospective driver may be issued a Cooperative Driver Testing Certificate, which must be signed by the driver education instructor and the student's parent (or legal guardian).
	- The certificate expires on the same day as the student's instruction permit and will not be extended.

Driving privileges will not be reinstated until consent is given (again) or the driver turns 18. The teen driver must reapply for a driver's license, take all applicable exams and pay the appropriate fees.

## Chapter 4: Traffic Laws

### Proper action when stopped by law enforcement
- Slow down, activate turn signal and safely pull over onto the right-hand shoulder of the roadway. If there is no shoulder or it is too narrow to pull over, find the next safest location and pull over.
- Do not slam on the brakes or stop in the lane of traffic. Do not stop your vehicle on bridges, curves, next to guardrails, concrete walls, medians or any place where it would be difficult for other vehicles to pass. A vehicle should not be stopped too close to the solid white line, as it may get struck by oncoming traffic.
- Stay in the vehicle with both hands clearly in sight on the steering wheel. Keep your hands on the steering wheel until the police officer instructs you otherwise or the traffic stop is complete.
- Be prepared for the officer to approach from either the driver or passenger side of your vehicle.
- Do not exit your vehicle unless asked to do so. Getting out of the vehicle can be perceived as aggressive behavior and a threat to the police officer's safety.
- Comply with the officer's request to see a driver's license and proof of insurance. If these items are in the glove box or under the seat or if the proof of insurance is stored for display on a cellphone, inform the police officer of that fact and then follow the officer's directions before retrieving the information.
- If you cannot identify an unmarked police vehicle and/or the driver as law enforcement, drive slowly and carefully below the speed limit and either (1) pull over at a well-lit, populated location, (2) drive carefully to the nearest police station and attempt to attract the attention of a uniformed officer or (3) call 9-1-1. Activate your vehicle's hazard lights as a helpful way to communicate intentions with the police officer.
- If you are being stopped at night, it is acceptable to turn on your interior light of the vehicle.
- Be aware that officers may not provide specific reasons for the stop until they have obtained your driver's license, vehicle registration and insurance card.

#### If the traffic stop results in a ticket or arrest
- Do not debate the reason for the stop or argue with the police officer.
- Do not refuse to sign a ticket if issued. A traffic ticket requires the driver's signature.
	- Signing a ticket is not an admission of the driver's guilt; only an acknowledgement of receiving the ticket.
- Do not be uncooperative with law enforcement at the scene. If you are suspected of drunk driving, refusal to submit to breath, urine, blood or performance tests can result in the loss of driving privileges.
- Do not argue about the ticket at the time of issuance.
	- If you believe an offense was not committed or the ticket was issued unfairly, you will have the opportunity to present the case in traffic court.
- Do not resist arrest if taken into custody by the police.

>[!important] You are to be treated with dignity and respect by law enforcement officers.
>If you believe than an officer has acted inappropriately during a traffic stop or other encounter, you should report the conduct to the officer's superiors ASAP. Officers are required to provide their names and badge numbers upon request. Written complaints can be filed with the agency's internal affairs division or civilian complaint board.
