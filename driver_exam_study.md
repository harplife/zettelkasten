# Illinois Rules of the Road

## Driving Examination
### Using turn signals
- Turn signals are required BEFORE:
	- Turning any corner
	- Turning into any driveway, parking lot, or parking space
	- Changing lanes of traffic
	- AFTER passing another vehicle
	- Pulling over to or away from any curb

### Leaving a parking lot or driveway
- You must stop before entering any street from a driveway, parking lot, or alley.
	- There may or may not be a stop sign present.
	- Use turn signal if appropriate.

### Stopping
- Stop behind the white line or crosswalk.
	- If there is no white line or crosswalk, stop before entering the intersection.
- Rolling stops are automatic failures on the driving examination.

### Turning a corner
- When turning a corner from a two-way street onto another two-way street, stay in your own lane and then turn into the lane where you will be driving.
	- Do not cut corners.

### Hill parking
- Signal toward the side of the road where you wish to park.
- Stop your vehicle parallel to the road, within 12 inches of the curb (or edge).
- If you park on a street with curbing, and
	- If your vehicle is heading downhill, turn the front wheels toward the curb.
	- If your vehicle is heading uphill, turn the front wheels away from the curb.
- If you park on a street without curbing (either downhill or uphill), turn the wheels toward the side of the road on which you are parked.
- Set the parking brake and put the gear selector in "Park".
- When leaving the curb, release your parking brake, turn the wheels from the side of the road, and use your turn signal.
	- Look for oncoming traffic. When it is safe, pull away slowly onto the street.

### Turn-about
- Turn-about requires that a vehicle turn left into an alley/roadway/driveway, back out towards the right, and then head to the direction that the vehicle was originally facing.
	- In other words, it's a U-turn with a few fancy steps.
- When you back out, yield to pedestrians and all vehicles.
	- Check all rearview mirrors and look over your right shoulder.

### One-way turns
- When turning onto a one-way street, turn into the first lane you come to.

### Multiple-lane turns
- When turning left onto a multi-lane street, turn into the inside lane (left-hand lane).
	- After you have completed your turn into the inside lane, turn on your signal light and move into the right-hand lane when it's safe.
- When turning right into a multi-lane street, turn into the first lane you come to (right-hand lane).
	- After you have completed your turn into the right-hand lane, turn on your signal light and move into the left-hand lane when it's safe.

### Backing vehicle
- When backing a vehicle, look over the right shoulder to check everything is clear in back.

### Other points that will be checked
- Driving speed : observe all speed limit signs. Do not drive too slowly.
- Center lines : do not weave back and forth across the center line. Stay in your traffic lane. If there is no center line, do not drive down the middle of the street (or road).
- Right of way :
	- Observe yield signs. When approaching a yield sign, slow down and check for traffic. Stop if necessary.
	- Approaching an intersection; when a green light appears, be sure the intersection is clear of vehicles and people before moving your car. If there are no signs or traffic control signals and two vehicles arrive at the same time, the car on the right has the right of way.
