# 3D CG Inquiry at Sibishi Academy
Recently, I've been looking into a career path of becoming a Technical Director for 3D Animation.
I put these jobs as my highest goal so that I could look into what qualifications I need :
1. [[technial_director_for_pixar_animation_studios|TD for Pixar]]
2. [[technical_director_for_marvel_studios_animation|TD for Marvel]]
3. [[technical_director_for_activision|TD for Activision]]

I saw that the most important qualification had to do with _Maya_.

So, I look into how I could learn Maya - the costly but effective way - by calling up Sibishi (pseudo-name) Academy and booking a time for inquiry about Maya learning courses.

This was on 2021/12/22 7:30 PM.

<span style="color: red">RED FLAG ♯1</span> : I am greeted with a salesperson in a very _fancy_ suit with a _BIG SMILE_.

Nothing deters me more than a salesperson acting the part.
Who I wanted was someone who looks like a professional in the _Digital Animation_ field, not a professional in _Sales_.
I knew right away I had to watch out for _exaggerated_ statements, perhaps _lies and deceit_.

continuing on.

The salesperson first gave me a questionaire with 5 questions to fill out.
1. Which field are you interested in? (e.g. game, FX, 2D, 3D, etc.)
2. Why do you want to learn? (e.g. Hobby, Self-Improvement, Career, etc.)
3. What is your job status? (e.g. Full Time, Part Time, Student, None)
4. What is important to you? Pick top 3. (e.g. Good Course, Good Teachers, Money, etc.)
5. What's your impression of the academy?

My answers,
1. 3D Animation
2. Career
3. Full Time(Developer)
4. Good Course, Good Teachers, Money
5. Clean

He looks over my answers, and he addresses number 1 ~ 3 first.
- "Are you thinking about changing your career to 3D Animation?" - yeah
- "Do you know much about it, and do you have any experience?" - No
- "Do you draw?" - No
- "What part of the field are you interested in?" - the technical part of the 3D Animation, where it requires programming.

He kinda looks at me funny, but that's okay. I know it's a bit ridiculous, that a person who has absolutely no background in _ART_ is looking into this.

Also, that's the point, isn't it? The main reason why I'm taking my time to get consulted isn't to get assurance, but rather, to get an information of what to expect.

So I ask him questions, like
- I want to become a Technical Director, what do I need to achieve that?
- I hear Maya is important, but what about other Houdini, Adobe, and other tools?

I don't remember all that he said, I got a few satisfying answers. BUT..

<span style="color: red">RED FLAG ♯2</span> : "How old are you?"

As soon as I heard the question, I got a sinking feeling in the chest.
I told him 29.
With a sorry face, he says "you are a bit too old to start out in the Animation field".

Not to mention I have zero background in Art. Yeah, I get that.

Of course, what he said wasn't meant to deter me from learning.
He continued, telling me that the Animation department tends to look for youth who displays promising talent, _BUT_ there are parts like _Rigging_ where I might be better suited.
Afterall, that's where _technical skills_ are needed.

He said, "I'm sure you'd appreciate being _realistic_. You are at that age afterall."

Realistic? _Yeah, maybe_.
I wanted to say there are plenty of artists who started out late and made their name in history.
But I didn't want to argue (as I don't remembe the names of those artists), and _Rigging_ sounds interesting.

So, the salesperson thought he got me interested on _Rigging_, and so he decided to bring the _Head of Department (3D Animation)_ to _really_ sell it.

For convenience, the Principal is now __Robert__, and the salesperson is __Steve__.

Steve went a way for a second, brought over Robert.

<span style="color: red">RED FLAG ♯3</span> : No introduction.

Robert came in, and Steve introduced him as the Head of Department.
Robert said hello. I said hello.

Was that it? Yeah, that was it. No name, no further introduction.
Robert the Head of Department, wow.

_ZERO CREDIBILITY_.

As I talked with Robert, however, he did seem to know his stuff.
He bragged about how some of his students went to big corporations (no names, of course).
I'd say he was 50% informative, and 50% bullshit.

Robert showed me Rigging Portfolios, explained how Rigging works, etc.
He, too, brought up the age limitation in the Animation industry.

Here's how he recommended Rigging as my career path : 
1. Rigging does not require creative talent (not as much as Animation).
2. Rigging is difficult (meaning technical skills are required).
3. Rigging is high demand low supply.
4. Rigging can be applied anywhere - 3D animation, Game, and Film.
3. There are some programming involved in Rigging.
4. Rigging's starting wage is around 4,000 manwon ($35,000 ish).

Basically, he's saying I need to go for _niche_, otherwise I have no chance.

I wasn't too opposed to what he was saying. Afterall, _realistic_, right?

But when I asked him these questions :
1. Do I need other skills to go along with Rigging, such as _Animation_, _Rendering_, _Effects_, and etc?
2. How do you advance from Rigger? (What career path follows after Rigger?)
3. How does the people in the industry think of Riggers who come from Hakwon (Academy, as opposed to legit school)?

The answers I got : 
1. No, just learn Rigging part of Maya. That's it.
2. Just keep doing Rigging (become a senior), become a manager, or start your own company.
3. They don't care about the educational background - they only care about the _portfolio_.

<span style="color: red">RED FLAG ♯4</span> : Rigging does not require in-depth knowledge in other skills.

I don't know much about Rigging, but that sounds _sketchy_.
From what I could understand, Animators learn Rigging as part of their course.
Learning only Rigging to be a Rigger sounds not only sketchy, it sounds _risky_.
Easily replaceable by any animators? no, thank you.

Also, when I came back home to do more research, I found that :
- Riggers have to understand Animator's intention, question their choices, and ask to change some things if necessary.
- Riggers have to balance functionality and simplicity because Animators have to work with the rig.

In other words, there are A LOT going on between Riggers and Animators.
It seems crucial to me to know _A LOT_ about animation, and other things that may interact with the rig.

<span style="color: red">RED FLAG ♯5</span> : A good portfoilo shows good movement.

Robert mentioned _good portfolio_ is appreciated more so than educational background.
It's art, so it made sense to me somewhat.
Even if you have a Master in Arts, if you don't have much to show for it, well..

Anyway, I asked Robert - what makes a portfolio _good_ then?

The answer I got?
_"The rigging has to show good, realistic movement."_

Yeah, _duh doy_.
I was expecting more specific answer on what separates a good rigging from a bad rigging.
I was asking for examples.

I was _seriously_ doubting Robert's credibility at this point.

I was somewhat sold on _Rigging_ as a profession, but learning that here? That was a no go.
Steve was an overly eager salesperson that made me cringe.
Robert was full of shit.
They didn't tell me what the teachers are like, what their backgrounds are.
I didn't get any detail on how the course goes.

And the final nail in the coffin was..

<span style="color: red">RED FLAG ♯6</span> : It's expensive, but it's worth it.

They must've been told they are expensive quite a number of times.
Steve actually said this to me at the beginning,
"It's expensive but we can talk about this after we discuss what we can offer you".

Since I hadn't a reference (of prices offered elsewhere), I could not make judgment based on comparison. The only thing that mattered was if the course was worth the money, and if I could afford it. So I decided to wait it out.

After an hour long consulting was over with (basically after Robert was done talking), Steve took over and told me he was going to print out the price estimate.

When he came back with a paper in his hand, he said,
"Wow, can you believe it, it's been 15 years since we've opened!"

Robert went "Oh wooow really?"

I literally thought I was watching some kind of sitcom.

Steve continued, "Yeah! It's amazing. Also, luckily, there is 25% discount for the 15 year anniversary!"

I just played along, "Oh wow! NICE. Lol"

Steve listed out bunch of other reasons for adding 5% discount here and there.
Of course, I don't buy into this (I worked in sales too, at one point).

But this one is a killer : "I'm giving you 5% more discount because I believe in you. But only if you sign up today".

Wow. Just wooow.

I was offended at this point. Does he take me for a fool?
No one in sane mind is going to just splurge.
I was given a lot of information, and I need time to process that.

I could go on, but I don't want to.

The total price was 500 manwon ($4500 ish) for 6 basic classes, 2 advanced classes, and 1 portfolio preparation class (11 month total) with the discount (originally 700 mw).

That's 50~60 manwon per course.

Maybe that's not too bad, I don't know.
Internet says 50~60 manwon is the "acceptable" price for top-notch hakwons.

Funny enough, internet also says Sibishi _sucks_.
- "All the portfolios I've seen from students from that place, were terrible"
- "I drop all the applicants who studied at Sibishi, no matter what"
- "Don't go to Sibishi - is on Google's search suggestion lol"
- "Salespeople at Sibishi are people who haven't even worked in the industry. They are more concerned about their quota, then about your career"
- "If you are going to learn, learn from someone who has made a name in the industry. Last time I checked, nobody at Sibishi did."


Anyway, I made up my mind to _definitely_ not to go to Sibishi Computer Arts Academy.

I do somewhat believe that going into Animation is not for me.
They did sell me on _Rigging_, but after hours of watching the _Rigging_ process vidoes on Youtube, I'm not so interested in it.

I need to go see other hakwons and gather more information, but I'm starting to think maybe I should learn Maya for hobby, rather than for career.
