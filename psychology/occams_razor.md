# Occam's Razor
In Philosophy, a _razor_ is a principle or rule of thumb that allows one to eliminate unlikely explanations for a phenomenon, or avoid unnecessary actions.
#todo this deserves its own note. See the [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_razor). Additionally, I feel that this idea somewhat conflicts with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's quote in Sherlock Holmes; "When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth".

Occam's Razor states that "Entities should not be multiplied beyond necessity".
This is often interpreted as "The simplest explanation is usually the best one".

Another interpretation, "Among competing hypotheses that predict equally well, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected".
