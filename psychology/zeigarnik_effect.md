# Zeigarnik Effect
the Zeigarnik Effect states that an activity that has been interrupted may be more readily recalled (than a completed activity).

## Related Information
- Bluma Wulfovna Zeigarnik (1900-1988) was a Soviet psychologist and psychiatrist, who discovered this effect in her 1920 study on memory.
- Several other studies have shown conflicting results with this study (e.g. Van Bergen 1968)
- (my thought) this pairs nicely with [[von_restorff_effect|Von Restorff Effect]], where an incomplete event shown in <span style="color:red;">RED</span> among completed events will stand out, and it will be memorable.
