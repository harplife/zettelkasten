# Fitts' Law
Fitts' law states that the amount of time required for a person to move a pointer (e.g. mouse cursor) to a target area is a function of the distance to the target divided by the size of the target.

In other words, the longer the distance and the smaller the target's size, the longer it takes for a person to reach the target (via pointer).
