- The term was coined by a German Psychologist, Hermann Ebbinghaus (1850-1909), through studies he performed on himself. Several other studies have proved his theory, such as [Murdock 1962](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-serial-position-effect-of-free-recall-Murdock-Bennet/f51820619ca42c5799f3c5acc3855671b905419c).
- In terms of UI/UX, positioning key actions on the far left/right within elements (such as navigation) can increases memorization.
