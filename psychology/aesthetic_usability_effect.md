# Aesthetic-Usability Effect
The Aesthetic-Usability Effect describes a _bias_ that people perceive more aesthetic designs as much more intuitive than those considered to be less aesthetically pleasing.

In other words, people are more tolerant of minor usability issues when the design of a product or service is aesthetically pleasing.
