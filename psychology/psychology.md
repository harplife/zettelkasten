# What is psychology
Psychology is the science of mind and behavior.

It is an academic discipline of immense scope, crossing the boundaries between the natural and social sciences.

Psychologies seek an understanding of the emergent properties of brains, linking the discipline to neuroscience. As a social science, they aim to understand the behavior of individuals and groups.
