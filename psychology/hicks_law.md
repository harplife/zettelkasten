# Hick's Law
Hick's Law states that the more choices a person is presented with, the _longer_ the person will take to reach a decision.

Specifically, Hick's law states that the time required to reach a decision increases _logarithmically_ with the number of choices. This means that the increase in time taken becomes less significant as the number of choices continues to increase. Thus, Hick's Law becomes less important when designing long lists (e.g. contact list), but it is crucial when designing short lists (e.g. navigation menu).
