# Doherty Threshold
Doherty Threshold states that a user's productivity soars when a computer and its users interact at a pace (<400ms) that ensures that neither has to wait on the other.

Note that this statement cannot be tracked to any source. There's not even a wiki.
This is not even based on a study.
It seems more like a sentiment that people started to believe in.

## Related Information
- In 1982, Walter J. Doherty and Ahrvind J. Thadani published, in the IBM Systems Journal, a research paper that set the requirement for the computer response time to be 400 ms, not 2 s which had been the previous standard.
