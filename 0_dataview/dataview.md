# Dataview
[Dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/) is a live index and query engine for Obsidian. The plugin reads [Metadata](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/annotation/add-metadata/) from a note, essentially creating a database of metadata from notes. It allows querying, using a [Dataview Query Language (DQL)](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/queries/structure/) query.

## Guide
- This [guide from makeuseof.com](https://www.makeuseof.com/obsidian-dataview-notes-guide/) is quite helpful. It's how it got me into using Dataview for the first time (2023-01-31).

## Metadata
- It's important to keep track of Keys and Values that are used in the database. Meaning, I'd have to think of a [[general_metadata_template|Metadata Template for General Use]], and also for Special Use.

## Queries
- [[status_query|Keep track of status of notes]], so that I can be aware of empty or ongoing notes.
- #todo keep track of edited date, so that I can go back and update old notes.
